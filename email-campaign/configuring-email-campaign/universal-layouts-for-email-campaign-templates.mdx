Universal Layouts in Salesmate help you create email templates faster while keeping your brand’s design consistent. Instead of building every email from scratch, you can use a reusable template and simply drag and drop content blocks.

<Note>
  **Note:** Universal Layouts are available on all Salesmate plans that include
  **Email Campaign** features. Any team member with the **"Manage Campaign
  Templates"** permission can create, edit, and manage these layouts.
