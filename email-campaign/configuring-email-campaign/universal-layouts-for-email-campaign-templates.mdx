Universal Layouts in Salesmate help you create email templates faster while keeping your brand’s design consistent. Instead of building every email from scratch, you can use a reusable template and simply drag and drop content blocks.**Note:**Universal Layouts are available on all Salesmate plans that include**Email Campaign**features. Any team member with the**“Manage Campaign Templates”**permission can create, edit, and manage these layouts.
