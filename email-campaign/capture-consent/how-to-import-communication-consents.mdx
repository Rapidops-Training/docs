[**Consent**](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/19613366377241) is a critical aspect of responsible and compliant email marketing practices. It refers to obtaining explicit permission from individuals or organizations before sending them marketing emails.

Salesmate has eased the process of importing Consents with an**easy-to-click Import Feature**. It would allow you to easily import your Consent inside Salesmate if you already have them captured.

*   Select the file and move further to mapping the fields.

*   In order to proceed further the User would first need to map the column that contains Email Id with Email.

*   Map all available columns from Excel to available Email Subscription Type Consents created within the system.

*   The system will map the fields automatically that have the same display name.

*   The user needs to tick the checkbox for**“I confirm that the preference from contacts who want to hear from me is legally acquired, and I will not send them spam messages and I understand that consent import can’t be reverted.”***   Click on**Start Import**to start importing the Consents.

<Note>


### Note:


*   You can map one subscription type only once within a single import.

*   At least one consent type selection is required to proceed further.
