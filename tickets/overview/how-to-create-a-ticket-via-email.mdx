Now, customers have the capability to generate a ticket simply by sending an email to Salesmate. This feature enables users to establish a forwarding rule within their email client, particularly if they employ a support email address to manage their customers' concerns.

### How to Create a Ticket via Email

Similar to email forwarding in Chats, you can set up email forwarding in your email client too for creating tickets via email.

To create a Ticket via Email,

- Navigate to the **Profile Icon** from the top right corner
- Click on the **Set Up**

- You can also set the reply-to name for this email address, by editing it and providing the name.
- When any emails are sent to this email address, their tickets are created in the Salesmate. \* By default, this ticket will be added to the **“Customer
  Tickets”** pipeline. \* While setting forwarding **Rules** from your Outlook Account, you need to select the **Redirect To** option.
