Now, customers have the capability to generate a ticket simply by sending an email to Salesmate. This feature enables users to establish a forwarding rule within their email client, particularly if they employ a support email address to manage their customers' concerns.

### How to Create a Ticket via Email

Similar to email forwarding in Chats, you can set up email forwarding in your email client too for creating tickets via email.

To create a Ticket via Email,

*   Navigate to the **Profile Icon** from the top right corner
*   Click on the **Set Up**
*   Head over to the **Modules** Category
*   Click on the **Tickets**

*   When any emails are sent to this email address, their tickets are created in the Salesmate.
*   By default, this ticket will be added to the **“Customer Tickets”** pipeline.
*   While setting forwarding **Rules** from your Outlook Account, you need to select the **Redirect To** option.
