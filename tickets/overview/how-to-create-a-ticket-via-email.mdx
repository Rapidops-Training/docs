Now, customers have the capability to generate a ticket simply by sending an email to Salesmate. This feature enables users to establish a forwarding rule within their email client, particularly if they employ a support email address to manage their customers' concerns.

### How to Create a Ticket via Email

To create a Ticket via Email,

*   Navigate to the **Profile Icon** from the top right corner

*   Head over to the **Modules** Category
*   Click on the **Tickets**
