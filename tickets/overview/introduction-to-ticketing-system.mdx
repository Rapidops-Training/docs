A ticketing system serves as a vital tool for monitoring the status of issues or requests in a structured manner, particularly in collaborative work environments. It provides a centralized platform for customer support teams to create, update, and monitor tickets, which represent individual cases or incidents.

With our new Ticketing system businesses can enhance their customer support processes, improve response times, and maintain a systematic approach to handling customer issues, ultimately contributing to better customer satisfaction and retention.

With our Ticketing System, you can create

*   **Internal Ticket:** The tickets in this pipeline would not be visible to the customers and are meant to be for internal purposes only
*   **Customer Ticket:** The tickets in this pipeline are visible to the customers, and the tickets that are created by customers also fall in this pipeline.Â
