**SLA (Service Level Agreement)** is defined as the agreed-upon level of service that a customer can expect in terms of issue resolution or response time. They establish priority levels and escalation guidelines, ensuring prompt attention to critical issues.

Meeting SLA commitments enhances customer satisfaction and retention, potentially leading to positive referrals. In contractual agreements, SLAs maintain healthy business relationships. They promote efficiency by streamlining support processes, minimizing downtime, and including risk mitigation measures through penalties for non-compliance, encouraging proactive management. Overall, SLAs provide structure, transparency, and accountability, contributing to a positive customer experience and business success.
