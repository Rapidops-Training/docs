*   The password should be a mix of one capital letter, alphabets, and special characters without any spaces and it should be of a length of 10 to 20 characters.

*   Though we do not impose any time interval to change the password, however, the best practice should be to change it every quarter or frequently if the system is being shared by multiple people

*   Currently, there is no Hard limit on locking an account after multiple failed login attempts

*   We provide you with [2FA security](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/360037256811) & [Single Sign On (SSO)](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/360055262952) options to completely secure the account.
