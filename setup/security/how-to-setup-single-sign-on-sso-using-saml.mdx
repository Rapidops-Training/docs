Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication method that enables users to securely authenticate with multiple applications and websites by using just one set of credentials.  

If you have a Salesmate _Enterprise_ account and have SSO set up for your business, you can require users to log in to Salesmate using their SSO credentials.  

**Note:** Available in Pro and above Plans (For Legacy Accounts: Growth and above Plans).  

This setup process should be done by an IT administrator with experience creating applications in your identity provider account.

### What happens when you enable SSO login?

- If **Forced SSO Login** is enabled, users can log in **only via your identity provider**.  
- If **Forced SSO Login** is enabled, login via **password, 2FA, or Google** will **not work**.  
- If **SSO is enabled but not forced**, users can still log in via **password, 2FA, and Google**.

### Configure SSO in Azure Active Directory

1. Log in to your **Azure Active Directory**.  
2. Go to **Enterprise Applications** in the left sidebar.  
3. Click on **+ Create your application**.  
4. Type **Salesmate** in the "Whatâ€™s the name of your app?" text box.  
5. Select the option: **Integrate any other application you don't find in the gallery (Non-gallery)**.  

Once added, it will show the **Application Name**, **ID**, and **Object ID**.  
Additionally, it provides options to:

- Assign users and groups  
- Set up single sign-on  
- Provision user accounts  
- Enable self-service

### Assign Users and Groups

Under **Assign users and groups**, you can specify which users or groups will have access to this application.

### SAML Signing Certificate

2. Open it in **Notepad**.

4. Copy the key value between the tags `<X509Certificate>` and `</X509Certificate>`.
