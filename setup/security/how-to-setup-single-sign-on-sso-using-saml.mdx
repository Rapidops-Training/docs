title: "How to Setup Single Sign-On (SSO) using SAML"
---
Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication method that enables users to securely authenticate with multiple applications and websites by using just one set of credentials.

If you have a Salesmate _Enterprise_ account and have SSO set up for your business, you can require users to log in to Salesmate using their SSO credentials.

**Note:** Available in Pro and above Plans (For Legacy Accounts: Growth and above Plans).

This setup process should be done by an IT administrator with experience creating applications in your identity provider account.

###  What happens when you enable SSO login?

- If **Forced SSO Login** is enabled, users can log in **only via your identity provider**.
- If **Forced SSO Login** is enabled, login via **password, 2FA, or Google** will **not work**.
- If **SSO is enabled but not forced**, users can still log in via **password, 2FA, and Google**.
