Seats represent the type of license assigned to each user and define the level of access they receive. As an admin, you can track the total number of seats available in your account and see how these seats are distributed among users. This helps you monitor usage, manage licenses effectively, and ensure every user has the right level of access.**Topics Covered***   [View Available Seats](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/50643193776153-Track-Seats#h_01K4Z1F47MJHMRSK3S6Y7YTPA6)
