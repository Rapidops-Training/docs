**_Profile Permissions_** in Skara let you define what specific groups of users can view and do within your account. Each user is assigned a profile that governs their access to modules, features, and data, including pipeline-level visibility, and provides enhanced control across the account.

### User Profiles:

**Skara **comes pre-figured with two Profiles

- **Admin**
- **Standard**

#### **Admin Profile (Noneditable):**

- Admins have complete control across the platform.
- These users have full control and visibility over the system, except for private emails.
- **Skara **allows having multiple admins in the system.
- The primary registered user who signs up with \*\*Skara \*\*is an admin user by default.
- Admins can further delegate administrative privileges to other users

### **Standard Profile:**

- This profile is a starting point for regular users. It includes:
  - Users can be assigned either **Standard Rights** or custom rights created beyond the default options.
  - **Standard Rights** are assigned by default when a user is added.
  - These rights can be modified later based on user needs and responsibilities.
  - Standard Rights function as editable profiles.

### Understanding Permission Levels 

In the **Edit Profile** screen, you can define the exact actions users can perform across modules like Contacts, Deals, Pipelines, Tickets, etc.

- View Permissions: Controls what records a user can see within a module.
  - **None:** Users cannot view any records.
  - **Own only:** Users can only see records they own.
  - **Own & hierarchy:** Users can view records they own plus those owned by their subordinates.
  - **Any records:** Full visibility into all records, regardless of ownership.
- **Create Permissions**: Its toggle button controls whether a user can add new records.
  - **Toggle Off**: Users cannot create new records.
  - **Toggle On**: Users can create new records in the module.
- **Edit Permissions**: Controls whether a user can modify records.
  - **None**: No edit access.
  - **Own records**: Can edit only records they own.
  - **Own & hierarchy records**: Can edit their own records and those of subordinates.
  - **Any visible records**: Can edit any records that are visible to them.
- **Delete Permissions**: Controls whether a user can remove records.
  - **None**: No delete access.
  - **Own records**: Users can delete only the records they own.
  - **Own & hierarchy records**: Users can delete their own and subordinate records.
  - **Any visible records**: Can delete any records visible to them.

**Note:** When you define security roles in your organization and enable the **"Share data with peers"** option, the data is shared with peers only if they have access to **"Owned & hierarchy records"** for viewing, editing, or deleting.

**Note:** You can also set the **Deal’s Pipeline User Level access** for the specific profile directly under the profile permissions. For this, you must enable [Pipeline-Level permissions](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/44511091257753) under the Deal module.
