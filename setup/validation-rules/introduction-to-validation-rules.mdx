Salesmate now allows you to create custom validation rules to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the data entered in your records. These rules automatically check if the entered data meets your predefined conditions before allowing the record to be saved or updated. Whether it’s ensuring fields are filled out correctly or **preventing invalid entries**, validation rules give you more control over your **data quality**, helping businesses reduce errors and **save time** on manual corrections.

**Note:**Validation rules are available only on the **Enterprise Plan**.
