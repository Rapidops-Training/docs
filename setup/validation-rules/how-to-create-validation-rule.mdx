A**Validation Rule**ensures data accuracy and consistency by restricting the type of data users can enter into a specific field. It helps maintain accuracy by enforcing specific criteria before a record is saved or updated. Validation rules prevent errors, standardize data input, and improve overall database quality. They can be applied to various fields to control formats, enforce mandatory values, or restrict certain inputs based on business logic.
