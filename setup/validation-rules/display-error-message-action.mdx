We want to add a validation rule for the mobile field in a contact.On the screen, we need to set up a validation condition.The condition should specify that the mobile number must be at least 10 digits long.Once the condition is added, we will configure an action to display an error message.If the entered number has fewer than 10 digits, the system will show a message like **"Character length is not supported."**
