A**tag**is a label attached to the record to identify and group the records. Tags are a great way to manage your records, perform workflow actions on them, and automate your sales process.

Salesmate lets you add tags to Contacts, Companies, Activities, and Deals. Tagging can be useful when you want to quickly filter a particular set of records.**Topics Covered:***   [How to Create a New Tag](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/115001620111#h_01HAVFDSN5N7CRN4FTYSBSGK3X)
