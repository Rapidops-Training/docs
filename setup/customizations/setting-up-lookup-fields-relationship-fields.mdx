<Note>
**Note:***   Lookup fields are only available for the Contact, Company, Activity, Deal, and Custom modules.

*   You can create Lookup fields of the type Contact, Company, Product, Custom modules, and Users.

*   Third-party integrations like Zapier, Hubspot, or others might not be fully compatible with this feature.

*   We do not support bulk editing, mass operations, or workflow field updates for the lookup fields.

</Note>

We can create a relationship between two records using the lookup fields. For example, you can create a company-type lookup field to manage parent and child company relations. Or a contact type lookup field and track the investor who has invested in different companies.

These relations can be of the type of one-to-many or many-to-many.**One-to-Many (Single Lookup)***   A child company will have a single parent company, but a parent company can have many child companies. E.g., Alphabet is the parent company of Google, Google Fibre, Capital G, Loon, and many more. So this is a one-to-many relationship. In Salesmate, you can create such a relationship using a Single Lookup.**Many-to-Many (Multiple Lookup)***   One investor can invest in multiple companies, but a single company can have multiple investors too. So this kind of relationship can't be achieved using Single Lookup and we require many-to-many relationships, and hence this can be achieved using the Multiple-lookup field.**Topics Covered:***   [How to Create a Look-Up Field](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/360043520171-Setting-up-Lookup-Fields-Relationship-Fields#h_01HAVES9PSNY51CG0GAGW3MDF7)

### Filter using lookup fields

Salesmate lets you filter records using the lookup field's primary relation.

If you have created a single lookup field, then you will have the following options for your search query.


***Contains**- Include records, whereas the name matches partially.

***Does not contain**- Exclude records, whereas name matches partially.

***Is**- Include records, whereas the name matches exactly

***Is Not**- Exclude records, where the name matches exactly

***Starts With**- Include records, whereas the starting of the name matches partially.

***Ends With**- Include records, whereas the ending of the name matches partially.

***Is Unknown**- Include records, whereas the relationship is not defined.

***Has any value**- Include records, whereas the relationship is defined.

If you have created multiple lookup fields, then you will have the following options for your search query.


***Is -**Include records, where related record matches exactly

***Is Not -**Exclude records, where related record matches exactly

***Is Unknown -**Include records, where the relationship is not defined.

***Has any value**- Include records, where the relationship is defined.

<Note>


### Important Information


*   The single Lookup field's primary relation appears inside the listing screens of any module.

*   Multiple lookup field data will not be available inside grid listing screens. That info can only be seen on the record's detail page.

</Note>


### How do Multiple Lookup fields appear inside Salesmate?


*   They will appear in the form of widgets inside the right sidebar. You can re-order the position of the widget as per your requirement.
