title: "Setting up Lookup Fields (Relationship Fields)"
---

<Note>
  **Note:**

  - Lookup fields are only available for the Contact, Company and Ticket module.
  - You can create Lookup fields of the type Contact, Company and Ticket module, and Users.
  - Third-party integrations like Zapier, Hubspot, or others might not be fully compatible with this feature. 
  - We do not support bulk editing, mass operations, or workflow field updates for the lookup fields.
</Note>

We can create a relationship between two records using the lookup fields. For example, you can create a company-type lookup field to manage parent and child company relations. Or a contact type lookup field and track the investor who has invested in different companies.These relations can be of the type of one-to-many or many-to-many.

**One-to-Many (Single Lookup)**

- A child company will have a single parent company, but a parent company can have many child companies. E.g., Alphabet is the parent company of Google, Google Fibre, Capital G, Loon, and many more. So this is a one-to-many relationship. In Skara, you can create such a relationship using a Single Lookup.

**Many-to-Many (Multiple Lookup)**

- One investor can invest in multiple companies, but a single company can have multiple investors too. So this kind of relationship can't be achieved using Single Lookup and we require many-to-many relationships, and hence this can be achieved using the Multiple-lookup field.

### Filter using lookup fields

Skara lets you filter records using the lookup field's primary relation. If you have created a single lookup field, then you will have the following options for your search query.

- **Contains**- Include records, whereas the name matches partially.
- **Does not contain**- Exclude records, whereas name matches partially.
- **Is**- Include records, whereas the name matches exactly
- **Is Not**- Exclude records, where the name matches exactly
- **Starts With**- Include records, whereas the starting of the name matches partially.
- **Ends With**- Include records, whereas the ending of the name matches partially.
- **Is Unknown**- Include records, whereas the relationship is not defined.
- **Has any value**- Include records, whereas the relationship is defined.

If you have created multiple lookup fields, then you will have the following options for your search query.

- **Is** -Include records, where related record matches exactly
- **Is Not** -Exclude records, where related record matches exactly
- **Is Unknown -** Include records, where the relationship is not defined.
- **Has any value**- Include records, where the relationship is defined.

<Note>
  ### Important Information

  - The single Lookup field's primary relation appears inside the listing screens of any module.
  - Multiple lookup field data will not be available inside grid listing screens. That info can only be seen on the record's detail page.
</Note>

### How do Multiple Lookup fields appear inside Skara?

- They will appear in the form of widgets inside the right sidebar. You can re-order the position of the widget as per your requirement.
