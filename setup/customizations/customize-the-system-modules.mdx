title: "Customize The System Modules"
---

**Skara** allows you to update the names of the **System modules** according to the business needs.

Sometimes users know modules with different names and all CRMs have their **terminologies** to define the modules.

For example, **Organizations** may be defined as "**Accounts"** but in Salesmate by default, we define them as **"Companies"**.

Thus, you can replace the name of the Modules present in Salesmate and update them as per your choice.

- **More Examples:**
  - **Contact** to **People**
  - ****Company ****to****Organization**** 

Also, to pacify the grammar-hungry geeks we allow you to set the Singular and Plural names for the modules separately.
