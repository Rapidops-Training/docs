Unused Fields are essentially fields that are not needed in the Module Create Form and are moved to the Unused Field Section for organization.These fields are hidden and not visible anywhere in the system to users. They are only displayed to users with permission to change the layout. However, their values can still be accessed and modified through the APIs of the admin profile.
