We can use the Auto Increment field when you want numbers to increase automatically with each new record, instead of updating them manually. This is helpful for things like invoices, order numbers, or case IDs.

*   Navigate to the **Profile Icon** in the top right corner.
*   Click on **Set-Up**
*   Head over to any module
*   Select the **All Fields** tab
*   Click on **Add New Field** button

* **Prefix:** Here you can enter a prefix that stays constant for the field values (e.g., "INV" for invoices)

* **Number of Digits**: Here you can enter the number of digits that you want in the end value. For example, entering 3 would mean “INV001, INV002” etc.“ It is a number type field and required field

* **Starting Number**: Enter the number from where should the value start incrementing. For example, entering 100 would mean your values will be like “INV100, INV101, INV102” etc. It is a number type field and required field
