### Calculating Sales Commission

Admins would appreciate the CRM that auto-calculates Sales Commission for their individuals grabbing multiple opportunities and then releasing the incentives accordingly.

Formula = Deal Value \* (Commission percentage)Eg: A Salesman's commission on a $1000 sale would fetch him a $100 commission on a 10% commission rate

Formula = Sale Value - (Operating expenses + Commissions + Taxes)Eg: HallsCorp's net profit for the quarter was $100,000 after paying commissions to their employees and deducting the taxes and total expenses.
