Calculated Fields in Salesmate let you automatically generate values based on other field data, making it easier to keep records accurate and up-to-date. Here are some important rules and limitations for using calculated fields effectively:


*   ***No Double Calculations**: One calculated field can’t be used to create another calculated field. This keeps calculations clear and prevents any confusion between fields.

    ***Field Type Can't Be Changed**: After a calculated field is created, you can’t change its field type. If you need a different type, create a new calculated field with the type you want, and then delete the original one.

    ***No Lookup Fields in Filters**: You can’t use lookup fields in the filter conditions for calculated fields.

    ***Automatic Updates on Change**: Calculated fields automatically recalculate whenever a related field is changed, so they reflect new values based on updates to the base field (the “Field to Aggregate”).

    ***Where Calculated Fields Can Be Used**:

        *   Reports
        *   Export
        *   Workflow Conditions
        *   Report Conditions
        *   Automation Conditions
        *   Automation Triggers (specifically in Field Match, Smart Segment)
        *   Calculated fields can also be used as dynamic variables in automation workflows and other places where variables are supported.

<Note>
**Note:** These fields won’t appear as selectable variables in the UI.
</Note>


*   ***Limits on Calculated Fields**:

        *   The calculated field type cannot be updated
        *   They can’t be updated manually or through Workflow or Automation actions.
    ***Filter Application**: You can apply filters to calculated fields based on their data types, just like with regular fields.
