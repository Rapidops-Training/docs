Calculated Fields are a feature that lets you do calculations automatically by grabbing data from different parts of Salesmate. If you’ve used [Formula Fields](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/6295749427225) before, Calculated Fields are similar—but way more powerful because they can pull info from multiple areas, not just one.

For example, want to figure out the total money a customer has brought in? You can mix data from the Deals section and the Contacts section. Calculated Fields make this super easy, helping you save time and understand your data better.
