Exporting data from Salesmate is straightforward, and there are two ways to do this.


*   [Export from the List view](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/115001104931-Exporting-data-from-Salesmate#h_01FQH4YEXQQX17X63QTA0K6KMA)

*   [Export from Setup](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/115001104931-Exporting-data-from-Salesmate#B.)

A list view is an ideal way when you want to export what you see. You can combine fields from different modules ( Company, Contact, Deals, Activities) to pull out what you need. Whereas, exporting from Setup allows you to export all records from each module separately.

<Note>
**Note:**You will need Export [permissions](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/115000655109) to export the data.

<Note>
**Note:***   The link to download the file will be available for 30 days max. After that exported file will be deleted from the Salesmate server, and the download link will get disabled.

*   Anyone with export rights can see export history, but the file can be downloaded by the person who initiated the export or the person who is in the higher hierarchy of that person.

*   Only records of those people under you in the hierarchy will be available to you for export. Thus an Admin can export records for everyone in the organization.

*   We will send a notification and an email with a download link.
