### How to avoid duplicates:

The options are:


***Merge****Records**: It updates an existing entry with the new fields if any and wipes off fields that are left blank. In case you do not wish to update a specific field you can skip it while in the mapping for import.

***Create****multiple records**: This will not check for duplicates and create a new record.

***Skip records**: It will ignore the data fetched from the sheet and keep your record as it is.
