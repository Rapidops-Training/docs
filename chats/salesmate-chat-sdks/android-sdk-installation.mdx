### Install Salesmate Chat SDK

If you’re new to Salesmate Chat, you’ll need to [Configure the Salesmate Chat](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058369732) in your Salesmate account. Then you have three options:

*   Option 1: Install Salesmate Chat SDK with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

Add the following dependency to your app's `build.gradle` file:

dependencies {  
implementation 'Comming Soon'  
implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:20.2.+'  
}

*   Option 2: Install Salesmate Chat SDK without Push Messaging

dependencies {  
implementation 'com.github.salesmate:salesmate-chat-android-sdk:1.0.5'  
}

<Note>
**Important:** If you choose this method you won’t be able to send push messages.
</Note>

#### **Jitpack**

Salesmate Chat SDK is hosted on jitpack. You will need to add jitpack.io to your root build.gradle file.

allprojects {  
repositories {  
maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }  
jcenter() // if required  
}  
}

#### **Permissions**

*   We include the [INTERNET](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#INTERNET) permission by default as we need it to make network requests:

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

*   You will need to include the [READ\_EXTERNAL\_STORAGE](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) permission if you have enabled image attachments:

`<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>`

### Initialize Salesmate Chat

*   First, you'll need to get your Salesmate Chat **App key, Workspace Id, and Tenant Id**. To find these, just select the 'Android Tab' option in your Salesmate CRM Messenger Settings Installation section.

*   Then, initialize Salesmate Chat SDK by calling the following in the `onCreate()` method of your application class:

  
`val workspaceId` `=` `"your Workspace ID"`  
`val appKey` `=` `"your app key``"`  
`val tenantId` `=` `"your Tenant ID``"      `// Configuration   
`val salesmateChatSettings` `=`   
`SalesmateChatSettings``(``workspaceId``,` `appKey``,` `tenantId``,` `BuildType``.``DEVELOPMENT``)      // Initialization Salesmate Chat   SalesmateChatSDK.initialize(this, salesmateChatSettings)`  

<Note>
**Note:** If you don't currently implement a custom application, you’ll need to create one. A custom application looks like this:
</Note>

  
class CustomApplication : Application() {  
override fun onCreate() {  
super.onCreate()  
  
val workspaceId = "your Workspace ID"  
val appKey = "your app key"  
val tenantId = "your Tenant ID"  
  
// Configuration   
val salesmateChatSettings =   
SalesmateChatSettings(workspaceId, appKey, tenantId, BuildType.DEVELOPMENT)  
  
// Initialization Salesmate Chat  
SalesmateChatSDK.initialize(this, salesmateChatSettings)  
}  
}  

*   You’ll need to update your manifest to use your application:

`    <application    android:name=".CustomApplication">   </application>       `

### Login a User

*   You’ll now need to log in to users before you can communicate with them and track their activity in your app.

**Login your users (to talk to them and see their activity)**

*   Depending on your app type, you can log in to users. Here are the instructions :
*   Here we will create a user with basic user detail in Salesmate CRM Messenger.
*   If you have an app with logged-in (identified) users only (like Facebook, Instagram or Slack), follow these instructions:
*   You’ll also need to log in to your user anywhere they sign in. Just call:

  
`// Prepare a user's detail object`  
`val userDetail` `=` `UserDetails``.``create``()`  
  
`val email` `=` `"user's email address"`  
`val firstName` `=` `"user's first name"`  
`val lastName` `=` `"user's last name"`  
`val userId` `=` `"user's user id"` `// Unique id recommended`  
`userDetail``.``withEmail``(``email``)`  
`.``withFirstName``(``firstName``)`  
`.``withLastName``(``lastName``)`  
  
`SalesmateChatSDK``.``getInstance``().``login``(``userId``,` `userDetail``,` `object` `:` `LoginListener` `{`  
`override` `fun onLogin``()` `{`  
`// Login successfully`  
`}`  
  
`override` `fun onError``(``salesmateException``:` `SalesmateException``)` `{`  
// Login error `}`  
`})`

### How to Logout a User

*   When users want to log out of your app, simply call logout like so:

  
`// This clears the SalesmateChat SDK's cache of your user's data`  
`SalesmateChatSDK``.``getInstance``().``logout``()`
