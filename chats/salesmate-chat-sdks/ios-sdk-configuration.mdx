Track who your users are and what they do in your mobile app and customize the Salesmate Messenger. Here’s how to configure Salesmate Chat for iOS:

- [Update your User](#update-your-user)

- [Submit an Event](#submit-an-event)

- [Create a Custom Launcher](#create-a-custom-launcher)

### Update your User

- When you call a login method we create a user with his basic detail, if you want to change his basic detail then you can use update user functionality as per the below code snippet:

let email = "user's email address"
let firstName = "user's first name"
let lastName = "user's last name"

```swift
let userId = "user's user id" // Unique id recommended

SalesmateChat.update(userId: userId, email: email, firstName: firstName, lastName: lastName, completion: { (success, error) in}
 if error == nil {}
 // Update successfully
 } else {}
 // Update error
}
})
```

### Submit an Event

- You can log events in Salesmate Chat SDK that record what users do in your app and when they do it. For example, you could record the item a user contact from your mobile app, and when they contact it.

- *Objective-C**```objc
[SalesmateChat logEventWithEventName: @"contact_item" withData:@{}
@"created_date": @1260016272,
@"contact_id": @"011",
@"contact_detail": @{}
@"first_name": @"John",
@"last_name": @"Smith"
}
}];

````**Swift** SalesmateChat.logEventWith(eventName: "contact_item", withData: [
 "created_date": 1260016272,
 "contact_id": "011", "contact_detail":\[ "first_name": "John-3434", "last_name": "Smith" \]
\]);

### Create a Custom Launcher

- However, if you’d like Messenger to open from another location in your mobile app, you can create a custom launcher. This allows you to specify a button, link, or element that opens Messenger. For example, you can trigger the launcher to open when a customer clicks on your ‘Ask for support’ button.

- If you have a custom launcher, you can call:**Objective-C**```objc
- (IBAction)presentMessenger:(id)sender {}
 [SalesmateChat presentMessengerFrom: self];
}
```**Swift**

```swift
@IBAction func presentMessenger(_ sender: UIButton) {}
 SalesmateChat.presentMessenger(from: self)
}
````
