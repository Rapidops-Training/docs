Track who your users are and what they do in your mobile app and customize the Salesmate Messenger. Here’s how to configure Salesmate Chat for iOS:

- [Update your User](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/9811244877977#temp:C:TZEe96b02bb7f4d407eafc98d2fb)
- [Submit an Event](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/9811244877977#temp:C:TZEdf13f7e676a8465fb1dbbf0b3)
- [Create a Custom Launcher](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/9811244877977#temp:C:TZE4e86d68c6d494433bfa8dd97d)

### Update your User

- When you call a login method we create a user with his basic detail, if you want to change his basic detail then you can use update user functionality as per the below code snippet:

let email = "user's email address"  
let firstName = "user's first name"  
let lastName = "user's last name"  
let userId = "user's user id" // Unique id recommended

SalesmateChat.update(userId: userId, email: email, firstName: firstName, lastName: lastName, completion: { (success, error) in  
 if error == nil {  
 // Update successfully  
 } else {  
 // `U`pdate error  
}  
})

### Submit an Event

- You can log events in Salesmate Chat SDK that record what users do in your app and when they do it. For example, you could record the item a user contact from your mobile app, and when they contact it.

**Objective-C**

\[SalesmateChat logEventWithEventName: @"contact_item" withData:@{  
 @"created_date": @1260016272,  
 @"contact_id": @"011",  
 @"contact_detail": @{  
 @"first_name": @"John",  
 @"last_name": @"Smith"  
 }  
 }\];

**Swift**

SalesmateChat.logEventWith(eventName: "contact_item", withData: \[  
 "created_date": 1260016272,  
 "contact_id": "011", "contact_detail":\[ "first_name": "John-3434", "last_name": "Smith" \]  
\]);

### Create a Custom Launcher

- However, if you’d like Messenger to open from another location in your mobile app, you can create a custom launcher. This allows you to specify a button, link, or element that opens Messenger. For example, you can trigger the launcher to open when a customer clicks on your ‘Ask for support’ button.

- If you have a custom launcher, you can call:

**Objective-C**

- (**IBAction**)presentMessenger:(**id**)sender { [SalesmateChat presentMessengerFrom: **self**];
  }

**Swift**

**@IBAction** **func** presentMessenger(\_ sender: UIButton) { SalesmateChat.presentMessenger(from: **self**)  
}
