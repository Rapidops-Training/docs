### Update Info.plist

Photo Library usage:  
With the exception of apps that only support iOS 14+, when installing Salesmate Chat SDK, you'll need to make sure that you have a **NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription** entry in your **Info.plist**.

For apps that support iOS 13, this is required by Apple to access the photo library. It is necessary when installing Salesmate Chat SDK due to the image upload functionality. Users will only be prompted for photo library permission when they tap the image upload button.

### Initialize SalesmateChat

First, you'll need to get your Salesmate Chat SDK **App key, Workspace Id** and **Tenant Id**. To find these, just select the 'iOS Tab' option in your Salesmate CRM Messenger Settings Installation section.

<img src="https://support.salesmate.io/hc/article_attachments/50774166959257" alt="iOS App Key, Workspace Id and Tenant Id"/>
Then initialize Salesmate Chat SDK by importing `SalesmateChatSDK` and adding the following to your application delegate:

**Objective-C**

```objc
@import SalesmateChatSDK;

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    Configuration *config = [[Configuration alloc] initWithWorkspaceID:@"<Your iOS Workspace Id>" appKey:@"<Your iOS App Key>" tenantID:@"<Your iOS tenantID>" environment: 2];
    [SalesmateChat setSalesmateChatWithConfiguration: config];
}
```

**Note**:- For environments, 0 for Dev, 1 for Staging, and 2 for Production.

**Swift**

```swift
import SalesmateChatSDK

func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

let config = Configuration(workspaceID: "<Your iOS Workspace Id>",appKey: "<Your iOS App Key>",tenantID: "<Your iOS tenantID>")
SalesmateChat.setSalesmateChat(configuration: config)
}
```

### Login a User

You’ll now need to log in to your users before communicating with them and tracking their activity in your app.

**Login to your users (to talk to them and see their activity)**

- Depending on your app type, you can log in to users. Here are the instructions :  
  Here we will create a user with basic user detail in Salesmate Messenger.
- If you have an app with logged-in (identified) users only (like Facebook, Instagram or Slack) follow these instructions:
- You’ll also need to log in to your user anywhere they sign in. Just call:

```swift
let email = "user's email address"
let firstName = "user's first name"
let lastName = "user's last name"
```

```swift
let userId = "user's user id" // Unique id recommended

SalesmateChat.loginWith(userId: userId, email: email, firstName: firstName, lastName: lastName, completion: { (success, error) in
if error == nil {
// Login successfully
} else {
// Login error
}
})
```

### Log Out

When users want to log out of your app, simply call:

**Objective-C**

```objc
// This clears the SalesmateChat SDK's cache of your user's data
- (void)logout {
    [SalesmateChat logout];
}
```

**Swift**

```swift
// This clears the SalesmateChat SDK's cache of your user's data
func logout() {
    SalesmateChat.logout()
}
```
