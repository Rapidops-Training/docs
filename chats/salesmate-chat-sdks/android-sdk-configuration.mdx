Track who your users are and what they do in your mobile app and Customize the Salesmate Chat Messenger. Here’s how to configure Salesmate Chat for Android:

*   [Update your User](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/9809670603417#temp:C:fXD3d73c6d6acc3889756de6d1f6)
*   [Submit an Event](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/9809670603417#temp:C:fXD262cb5986570bf1fab4adc1c1)
*   [Create a Custom Launcher](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/9809670603417#temp:C:fXD1e0758ecd41c6e1680022700a)

### Update your User

*   When you call a login method we create a user with his basic detail, after if you want to change his basic detail then you can use update user functionality as per below code snippet:

  
`// Prepare a user's detail object`  
`val userDetail` `=` `UserDetails``.``create``()`  
  
`val email` `=` `"user's email address"`  
`val firstName` `=` `"user's first name"`  
`val lastName` `=` `"user's last name"`  
`val userId` `=` `"user's user id"` `// Unique id recommended`  
`userDetail``.``withEmail``(``email``)`  
          `.``withFirstName``(``firstName``)`  
          `.``withLastName``(``lastName``)`  
  
SalesmateChatSDK.getInstance().update(userId, userDetail, object : UpdateListener {  
override fun onUpdate() {  
// Update successfully  
}  
  
override fun onError(salesmateException: SalesmateException) {  
// Error on update  
}  
})

### Submit an Event

*   You can log events in Salesmate Chat that record what users do in your app and when they do it. For example, you could record the item a user ordered from your mobile app, and when they ordered it.

  
`// Prepare a record event object`  
  
val data = _hashMapOf_<String, String>()  
data\["orderId"\] = "order id"  
data\["productId"\] = "product id"  
  
val eventName = "order\_detail"  
SalesmateChatSDK.getInstance().recordEvent(eventName, data)

### Create a Custom Launcher

*   However, if you’d like Messenger to open from another location in your mobile app, you can create a custom launcher. This allows you to specify a button, link, or element that opens Messenger. For example, you can trigger the launcher to open when a customer clicks on your ‘Ask for support’ button.

*   If you have a custom launcher, you can call:

  
`// To launch messenger`  
SalesmateChatSDK.getInstance().startMessenger()
