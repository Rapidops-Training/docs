Track who your users are and what they do in your mobile app and Customize the Salesmate Chat Messenger. Here’s how to configure Salesmate Chat for Android:

- [Update your User](#update-your-user)

- [Submit an Event](#submit-an-event)

- [Create a Custom Launcher](#create-a-custom-launcher)

### Update your User

- When you call a login method we create a user with his basic detail, after if you want to change his basic detail then you can use update user functionality as per below code snippet:

```kotlin
// Prepare a user's detail object
val userDetail= UserDetails.create()
val email = "user's email address"
val firstName = "user's first name"
val lastName = "user's last name"
val userId = "user's user id" // Unique id recommended
userDetail.withEmail(email)
 .withFirstName(firstName)
 .withLastName(lastName)

SalesmateChatSDK.getInstance().update(userId, userDetail, object : UpdateListener {}
override fun onUpdate() {}
// Update successfully
}

override fun onError(salesmateException: SalesmateException) {}
// Error on update
}
})
```

### Submit an Event

- You can log events in Salesmate Chat that record what users do in your app and when they do it. For example, you could record the item a user ordered from your mobile app, and when they ordered it.

```kotlin
// Prepare a record event object

val data = hashMapOf<String, String>()
data["orderId"] = "order id"
data["productId"] = "product id"

val eventName = "order_detail"
SalesmateChatSDK.getInstance().recordEvent(eventName, data)
```

### Create a Custom Launcher

- However, if you’d like Messenger to open from another location in your mobile app, you can create a custom launcher. This allows you to specify a button, link, or element that opens Messenger. For example, you can trigger the launcher to open when a customer clicks on your ‘Ask for support’ button.

- If you have a custom launcher, you can call: ```kotlin // To launch messenger
SalesmateChatSDK.getInstance().startMessenger() ```
