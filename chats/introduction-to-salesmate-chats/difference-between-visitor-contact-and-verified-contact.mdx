Understanding the different categories of customers in Salesmate Chats helps you provide better service and manage your conversations effectively.

## Who is a visitor?

A visitor is any unknown person browsing your website. At this stage, you have no identifiable details or ongoing communication with them.

## When does a visitor become a contact?

A visitor becomes a contact once they start a conversation with you and provide some form of contact information (such as an email or phone number). This allows you to follow up with them in the future.

## Who is a verified contact?

A verified contact is someone who has signed up or logged into your app. Since their identity is confirmed, they are recognized as an authenticated customer. Any impersonation warnings in their conversations are automatically removed once verification is complete.
