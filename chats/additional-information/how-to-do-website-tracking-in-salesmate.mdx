### Event-Based Tracking

- Following the Event-Based Tracking method simply collects the data in either of the cases like; while the user is Signing Up, Logging In, Logging Out, Performing any step using the Call-to-Action button, or be it any Custom Event Listener using the JS API Method. You can refer to other events [here](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/360062373471).

#### Making Event-Based Action 

- You can call this method in the situation where the contact or the visitor is not logged in when the page is loaded. You can also use this method to update the contact information that is logged in. Verify your contact by calling this method and passing the email in userid.

For example, on your customer's login page action, call this method when the login button is clicked.

```javascript
SALESMATE.login({
  user_id:
    "/* user id | string | We recommend to pass user's email id to generate unique key */",
  email: "/* email | string | pass a valid email address */",
  first_name: "/* first name of contact | string */",
  last_name: "/* last name of contact | string */",
});
```

#### **Example:**

```javascript
SALESMATE.login({
  user_id: "john.doe@example.com",
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
  first_name: "John",
  last_name: "Doe",
});
```

This is how you can capture the contact details of the visitor without bothering them. You can then plan any [Automation Journeys](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/360057066552) or enroll them in [Sequences.](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/360033759131)

#### Making Landing Page-Based Action

You can use "Page Visited Trigger" to set up the journey and perform a certain set of actions in the automation journey. This method will initiate the trigger as soon as the visitor lands on any specific page.

### FAQs

**Can I track my website visitors without paying any additional cost for Messenger?**

- Ans: No. You need at least one license messenger license. Our messenger script works as a website tracking script itself where it requires a trigger / interaction to start tracking your visitor / customer activity.

**How can I collect data from customers?**  
Ans: These are the ways you can collect the data:

- Add Call-To-Action Button on your website and use any of the Event-Based Action using Event-based Action via the JS API Method. This could be any Login action, Logout, Signup, Contact Us, etc.
- You can redirect the users to another page where you can collect the basic details like Names and Email addresses. It could be any specific landing page with a form. Use the Track Custom Event Code to capture the information in Salesmate.

**Where can I see the tracking in Salesmate?**

- Ans: In the Contact Detail Page, you will find the details in the Page View section on the right.

<img src="https://support.salesmate.io/hc/article_attachments/31912813993497" alt="Contact Page View" />
**How can I automate the process once the data is collected?**  
Ans: Automation Journey and Sequences can be used to make it a non-manual process to stay connected with your customers.

- **Instance 1:**  
  With Automation Journey, you can use the "Event" Trigger to initiate the journey and send automated Emails using Sequences.  
  On Event trigger, you can enroll that Contact to a Sequence.

<img src="https://support.salesmate.io/hc/article_attachments/11003423805849" alt="Event Trigger in Automation Journey" />
- **Instance 2:**  
  If you do not want to enroll the Contacts to Sequence, you can perform Bulk/Mass Operation too. Using the Event trigger in Automation Journey, you can assign Tag to those Contacts and further filter the data to perform Bulk/Mass operation.
  - Step 1: Create Automation Journey to assign Tag to Contact

<img src="https://support.salesmate.io/hc/article_attachments/11003642310169" alt="Assign Tag in Automation Journey" />
- Step 2: Filter the Contacts based on the Tag. Bulk select the Contacts and perform "Send Email" or "Sent Text"

<img src="https://support.salesmate.io/hc/article_attachments/31912897496089" alt="Bulk Email or Text" />
This is how the Contacts created via website tracking can be contacted further for marketing purposes.
