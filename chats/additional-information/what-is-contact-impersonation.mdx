When a new visitor starts a chat with you, he might share an email address that might not belong to him.

*   If Salesmate cannot identify the visitor as a [verified contact](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058808931) i.e. the email shared by the visitor belongs to him or not, then messenger will show an impersonation warning with every chat message sent by this visitor.
*   Salesmate will auto consolidate contact information once the visitor is identified as verified contact after login or signup.
*   The impersonation warning is removed once the visitor identifies himself by logging in with the same email in Salesmate.
