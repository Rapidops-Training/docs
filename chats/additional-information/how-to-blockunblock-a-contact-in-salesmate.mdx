Salesmate allows you to **block/unblock** a contact. If a contact is abusive, offensive, or spamming, then they can be blocked by selecting the block option from the contact's detail view.

Once a contact is blocked inside Salesmate there will be no new emails or chat requests received from the blocked contact.

If you want to unblock a blocked contact, in that case, you can manually do it in order to start receiving new messages from them in the future.

### Example:

If someone is constantly sending messages to you in chat and is spamming your chat box you can block them so that no further messages come from them in Salesmate.

If you are constantly receiving some unnecessary emails from a particular contact, then you can block them so that no more emails come from them in Salesmate.

<Note>


**Note:**

*   Once you Block the Contact it will hide the Associated Conversation
*   In the case of group conversation, the action option will only be visible in the primary contact and not in the secondary contacts, thus only the primary contact can be blocked with the above-mentioned steps, in case of a group conversation.
*   In the blocked contact list, the default sorting is based on the date the contact is blocked, i.e the contact which is blocked most recently will show on top.
