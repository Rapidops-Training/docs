### When does the system send a notification

#### Push Notifications for chat messages

- Salesmate waits for 10 seconds before sending push notification to user. If the user hasn't read the message within 10 seconds, then a notification is fired. The delivery speed of notification can differ based on the notification queue on the server.

#### Email Notifications for chat messages

- Email notifications are delayed by two minutes. If the user reads the conversations inside Chats within two minutes, then the notifications are not sent. Salesmate groups the email notifications, so multiple replies, notes, or other conversation changes in a single email if the person hasn't read the conversation within two minutes.

<Note>

**Note:**

- Chat notification preferences are only available to users with an active messenger workspace.
- Without a messenger license, the user won't be able to modify his chat notification preferences.
- If you are **Away or Away and Reassign**, you will not get the sound notification
  - Click on the **Profile Icon** top right- Click on the **downwards** arrow to set your availability
  - Here if you select either **Away or Away and Reassign**, you will not get the sound notification
