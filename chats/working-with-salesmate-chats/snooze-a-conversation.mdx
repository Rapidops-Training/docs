Conversations can be put on hold by snoozing them to follow up later. Snooze comes very helpful when you are waiting for a response from your teammate or customer, and at the same time, you might wanna resolve another customer's query while you're waiting, but don't wanna forget about the current customer.

Snoozed conversations open automatically when the snooze period ends or when activity occurs within the conversation.

### How to snooze a conversation?

*   The Conversation will be reopened.
*   Once you snooze a conversation, it vanishes from the open conversation list and moves to the snoozed conversation list, which can be opened by selecting the filter.

### When does a snoozed conversation reopen automatically?

A snoozed conversation will reopen automatically only when:

*   The snoozed time period is over.
*   A new message is posted by a user or customer
*   The conversation is reassigned to other user or team

<Note>
**Note:** For each activity like when the conversation was snoozed, or who snoozed it, and when it reopened, the timeline entries will be displayed inside the conversation as per your selected timezone.
