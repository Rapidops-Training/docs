You can sort the conversations based on **Newest**, **Oldest**, **Waiting longest**, and **Priority.**

*   **Newest** - This shows you the conversation having the most recent activity. So the conversation with the most recent activity will appear at the top.
*   **Oldest** - This shows you the conversation that has the oldest activity.
*   **Waiting longest** - Shows the conversations in order of how long the contact has been waiting for a response. And if the client has made additional responses or if there are internal notes or activities, the first date on which the conversation has not received a response from the user is used.
*   **Priority** - Shows the flagged conversations at the top with the most recent activity. [Learn More](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058891771)
