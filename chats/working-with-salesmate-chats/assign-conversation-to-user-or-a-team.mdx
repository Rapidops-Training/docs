<Note>
**Note:** Conversations can only be assigned to the users who have a Chat license. 
</Note>

*   If the conversation was already assigned to a team then it remains unchanged. As it helps in the case when the assigned user has [enabled away mode](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058439252), other members of the team can respond to the customer.

### Assigning Conversation to a Team

*   In the same way, you assigned a user, you can choose a team from the ownership dropdown and assign a conversation to it, and any user assigned to the conversation will be removed from it.
