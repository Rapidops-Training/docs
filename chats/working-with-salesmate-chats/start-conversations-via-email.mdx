#### You can use Salesmate Chats to support the traditional ticketing system too. You can forward your support queries to Chats default email address and it will auto-create the conversations inside. The users can reply to those conversations and the customer will receive those replies via email in the form of a chat conversation.

### Where to find the Chat inbox email address?

*   Navigate to **Conversations Icon** on the left menu bar
*   Click on **Chats**
*   Head to **Chat Settings** on bottom left**.**

<Note>
**  
Notes:**

*   The subject of the email becomes the conversation's title when a conversation is created.
*   The body of the email becomes the conversation message.
*   If you have disabled the attachments then any attachments associated with the email will be dropped.
*   Avoid company's email addresses getting added to a conversation by adding them to [ignore list](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/4407250022029).
