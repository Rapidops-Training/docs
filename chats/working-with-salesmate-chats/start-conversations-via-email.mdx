<Note>
  **Notes:**

  - The subject of the email becomes the conversation's title when a conversation is created.
  - The body of the email becomes the conversation message.
  - If you have disabled the attachments then any attachments associated with the email will be dropped.
  - Avoid company's email addresses getting added to a conversation by adding them to [ignore list](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/4407250022029).
