<Note>
  **Note:** By default, the email transcript is sent from [noreply@salesmatemail.com,](#how-salesmate-users-can-download-or-email-transcripts) but If the user wants to send the email from his domain, then [Salesmate also allows
  that by enabling
  DKIM](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/360006983771), and then the transcript will be sent from the user's email address instead of [noreply@salesmatemail.com.](#how-salesmate-users-can-download-or-email-transcripts)
