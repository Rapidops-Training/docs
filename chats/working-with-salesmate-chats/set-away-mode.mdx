* Away status is shown for the users who are inactive for the last 5 minutes and
don't have any Salesmate tab open inside their browser. Other users or visitors
will be able to see the status, but none of the conversations are reassigned to
others.

<Note>

- **Note:** If you set your availability as **Away or Away and Reassign Conversations**, you will not get any sound notification for the new messages.
