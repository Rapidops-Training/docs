You might often need to **search** your past conversations to refer to the conversation history with a contact, reference, or get context on older discussions. Also, Track which pages your Lead or Contact has visited before starting the conversation.

With our new "Recent Conversations and Page Views" widgets on **Chat Inbox** and on the **Contact detail view** page, you can see the latest conversations and page views to understand or track any recent interactions.

**Recent Conversations and Page Views on Chat Inbox:**

Here, whenever you receive a chat from a Lead or Contact, you get an option to check if any previous conversation has been made or not, this helps you to identify the history of the Lead or Contact's requirement or query. Track pages visited by Lead or Contact.
