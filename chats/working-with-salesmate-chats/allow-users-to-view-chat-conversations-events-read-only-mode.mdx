title: "Allow Users to view Chat Conversations & Events (Read-Only mode)"
---

This feature allows users without an assigned chat license to view chat conversations and events in a read-only mode. It ensures that even users without full chat permissions can review important interactions, monitor discussions, and stay informed about relevant events without the ability to modify or interact directly.
