* Salesmate Chats provides users and customers to respond to conversations via email, which makes it easier for people to not let any conversation go incomplete and respond directly via their mail.

### Contacts can reply via email

If contact is not online or doesn't see your message then an email notification is sent to the contact after 2 minutes, to make sure that contact receives your response. If he replies to that email then the response is updated inside the conversation.

<Note>
**Note:**

*   If the contact replies using any other email than the primary email then a new conversation is created.
*   If the attachments are not allowed then the attachments are dropped from the email and a log message is placed inside the conversation, you can [refer to this article for attachment settings](https://support.salesmate.io/knowledge/articles/360058435732/en-us?brand_id=1467849)

### Users can post a reply via email

If a user is not online while a new conversation is started or a reply comes to an old conversation, then he will get an email notification for the same. He can simply reply to that email, and his response will get updated inside the conversation.

<Note>
**Note:** He will only get an email notification if he enabled it, you can [refer to this article on how to enable chat notifications.](https://support.salesmate.io/knowledge/articles/360058878071/en-us?brand_id=1467849)

### User can post a note via email

If a teammate has mentioned you or you have enabled notifications for the notes, then you will get an email notification, and replying to such an email will post a note inside the conversation.
