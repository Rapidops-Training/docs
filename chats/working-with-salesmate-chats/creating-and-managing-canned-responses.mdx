<Note>
- While you provide a **Title** in the Canned Response, make sure it has proper reference as it will be the primary way your teammates will **search** for, **share** and use **Canned Responses**, so make it more clear and concise.
- You can apply **attributes** e.g. \{\{Contact.name\}\} to address your Customers and Leads, Salesmate offers Merge Fields for all available Custom Fields in the account.
- The content is not sent immediately when you apply the Canned Responses, so you’ll always have the opportunity to customize it further.
