### How do attachments work?

- When a visitor or customer sends an attachment over Unified Inbox, it is uploaded on a server with an accessible URL. Generally, these URLs are not indexed by a search engine, but it is not suggested to ask for private documents over chat.

### Which attachments can a user upload?

- Please note the attachment upload setting is not applicable for the users. They can always upload and send the attachments to the contacts. Learn more about [allowed attachment types](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/360059349132)

### What happens if a contact sends attachments via email?

- If you have disabled the option for uploading attachments, then attachments sent by the contact are dropped from the Unified Inbox.
