By default, the Chats has been set up in such a way that it auto asks for the name and email address when the user hasn't responded to the visitor within 2 minutes.

But you can configure the name and email requirement for starting a new conversation where you can decide on capturing the name & email address of the visitor whenever they start a new chat so that you can always get back to them in the future if required.

To change these settings, follow the below steps:

*   Navigate to **Conversations Icon** on the left menu bar
*   Click on **Chats**
*   Head to **Chat Settings** on bottom left**.**

*   Switch to the **Require Details** tab and select the option which fits your requirement.
*   Select when you want to ask for the name & email address for starting a new conversation:
    *   **Only outside office hours:** Chats will ask for the name and email address whenever the visitor starts a new conversation outside your working hours. [Learn more about how to set up office hours](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058435612).
    *   **Always:** Chats will ask for the name and email address every time the visitor starts a new conversation, no matter what time it is.
    *   **Never:** In this case, the visitor can start a new conversation and won't be asked for the name & email address.
*   Hit the **Update** button to save your changes.

<Note>
**Note:**

*   In all the above cases, Chats automatically asks for the name and email address of visitor, if they don't receive any response within 2 minutes. This only happens if Salesmate does not recognize the visitor i.e. if the name and email address are captured previously then it won't be asked.
*   Only users with ["Manage Chat Settings" permission](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058438992) can access the above settings.
