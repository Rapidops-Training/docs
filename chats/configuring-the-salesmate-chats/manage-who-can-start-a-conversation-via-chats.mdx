Salesmate Messenger now gives you full control over who can start a new conversation.

You can now choose to allow all visitors to start a new conversation, or you can choose to let only specific visitors or customers start new conversations.  
  
For example, if you only operate for the customers of the United States, then you can now configure the settings such that the **start new chat** button will be visible to only those visitors who are located in the United States.

### Configuring settings for conversations

*   Navigate to **Conversations Icon** on the left menu bar
*   Click on **Chats**
*   Head to **Inbox Settings** on the bottom left**.**

    *   Add any number of conditions by clicking on Add condition button

*   *   The settings shown in the above image will enable all the visitors to start a new chat whose location is Germany (as per their browser).

These settings are applied asap the widget is loaded on the website. To know about full control over conversations, refer to this article: [Prevent replies to a closed conversation](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/4405807330829)

### What will visitors see on your Messenger?

When visitors come to your website, and if they don't match the conditions to start new conversations, then they will not see the button to start a new chat. But they will see the list of their previous conversations if it exists, and can reply to their previous conversations (if allowed).

<Note>
**Note:**

*   Only users with [“Manage messenger settings” permission](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058438992) can access this setting.
*   These settings do not apply to the conversations that are created via email.
*   The people, however, cannot start a new chat as per the above settings, but they can always reply to their ongoing conversations.
