### Configure setting to prevent replies

*   Click on **Chats**
*   Head to **Inbox** **Settings** on the bottom left**.**

<Note>
**Note:** The system recommends a 3-day limit by default to prevent replies in closed conversations.

*   Once enabled, you can also choose the number of days until replies will be accepted after closing the conversation. In short, the conversation can be reopened within that time. 
*   Once this limit is exceeded, the system won't allow the customer or visitor to reply in a closed conversation.

### What do customers see on the widget?

*   Contacts or visitors can always see the closed conversations but can't post any new replies. The system will encourage them to boot a new conversation for further queries. Such a mechanism is helpful to keep conversations more organized and helps measure the effectiveness of teammates for replying and closing conversations on time.

**Note:**

*   Only users with [“Manage messenger settings” permission](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058438992) can access this setting.
*   If a contact replies to a closed conversation via email, then that message will start a new conversation if the time limit has been reached, otherwise, the conversation will be reopened and the message will be posted.
*   If the user replies in a closed conversation, then the conversation will be reopened and a message will be posted, as these settings do not affect the user behavior.
