* **article detail view**instead.

* **Published**mode based on its current status.

### Editing an Article in Draft State

### Editing an Article in Published State

* **Clicking a** published article takes you to the

* **detail view**.

* Any content changes you make here will:

* Be saved in a**new draft version**. * Not affect the live article until you click**Publish**.

* To view or edit these changes, open the editor, it will display the draft version.

### Configuration Changes:

* Configuration updates (like changing Slug, Category, Visibility, or AI Settings) require publish permission and when these changes are saved, the article is automatically published.

* Without publish rights, you won’t be able to edit these settings.

### Additional Actions for Published Articles

While viewing a published article, you can also:

* Edit the content (saved as a draft)

* Clone the article

* Unpublish it (which reverts it to a draft)

* Reassign or change the category

* Review the article’s version history

* Archive the article

* Permanently delete it
