## Format the Article Details

You’ll use the article editor’s toolbar to format your content. Here’s what you can do:

*   **Text Formatting**:
    
    *   Apply heading styles (H1, H2, H3, H4, Paragraph) for titles and sections.
        
    *   Use bold, italics, underline, or strikethrough to emphasize text.
        
    *   Change text or background color, add subscript/superscript, or insert emojis.
        
    *   Clear all formatting from selected text.
        
*   **Paragraph Formatting**:
    
    *   Align text left, right, center, or justified.
        
    *   Create bulleted lists (default, circle, disc, square) or numbered lists (default, lower alpha, lower greek, lower roman, upper alpha, upper roman).

*   **Lists**:
    
    *   To start a bulleted list, type a dash (-) or asterisk (\*) and a space at the start of a line.
        
    *   To start a numbered list, type “1.” and a space, then keep typing.
        
    *   Press Tab to nest a list item; press Enter twice to end the list.
        
*   **Links**:
    
    *   Select text, place your cursor, and click the link icon to add a hyperlink.
        
    *   Link to a URL (e.g., https://salesmate.io/, include full URL to avoid broken links).
        
    *   Link to a heading in the current article using the Heading tab.
        
    *   Link to another knowledge base article using the Article tab (recommended for multi-language Knowledge Base).
        
    *   Choose whether the link opens in a new tab.
        
    *   Links will auto-update if an article’s title or domain changes.
        
*   **Anchor Links**:
    
    *   Hover over a heading (H1, H2, H3, H4) in the editor or article detail page to see a “Copy anchor link” button.
        
    *   Click to copy a link to that section, which you can paste in your product, website, other articles, or messages.
        
    *   The link stays valid if the heading text changes and works across all languages, but changes if you move the heading.
        
*   **Images**:
    
    *   You can click the image icon to upload or insert an image and set height and width in pixels, add alt text for accessibility, or embed a URL for clickable images.
        
    *   You can also align images left, center, or right, or wrap them with text for inline use.
