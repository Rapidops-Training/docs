###  Configuring the Knowledge Base **_If no Knowledge Base exists:_**Click on the dropdown to create one. If you don’t, the option will be disabled automatically.

- **_If a Knowledge Base exists:_** If only one knowledge base is available, it will be selected by default.

- If multiple knowledge bases exist, the first one will be selected. _ If a knowledge base is already configured in **Copilot settings**, it will appear here by default. _ If none or multiple exist, the field will appear blank.

* **_Choosing a different Knowledge Base than Copilot’s:_** When you try to choose a different knowledge base than what is chosen under Copilot, you will see this message: "It seems you are using a different knowledge base for Copilot. Are you sure you don’t want to keep it the same"?

- Upon confirmation, the new selection will be saved. Otherwise, it will revert to the Copilot knowledge base.

<Note>

**Note:** You will need “Manage Chat Settings” or “Manage Unified Inbox” permissions to update these settings.

- The Knowledge Base can be configured without enabling articles for the customer side in Messenger.

- The Home and Chat sections of the chat's layout are always enabled, and they cannot be disabled.
