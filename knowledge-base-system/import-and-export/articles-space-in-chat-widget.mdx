### Configuring the Knowledge Base

*   **If no Knowledge Base exists:**
    *   Click on the dropdown to create one. If you don’t, the option will be disabled automatically.
*   **If a Knowledge Base exists:**
    *   If only one knowledge base is available, it will be selected by default.
    *   If multiple knowledge bases exist, the first one will be selected.
    *   If a knowledge base is already configured in **Copilot settings**, it will appear here by default.
    *   If none or multiple exist, the field will appear blank.
*   **Choosing a different Knowledge Base than Copilot’s:**
    *   When you try to choose a different knowledge base than what is chosen under Copilot, you will see this message: "It seems you are using a different knowledge base for Copilot. Are you sure you don’t want to keep it the same"?
    *   Upon confirmation, the new selection will be saved. Otherwise, it will revert to the Copilot knowledge base.

<Note>
**Note:**

*   You will need “Manage Chat Settings” or “Manage Unified Inbox” permissions to update these settings.
*   The Knowledge Base can be configured without enabling articles for the customer side in Messenger.
*   The Home and Chat sections of the chat's layout are always enabled, and they cannot be disabled.
