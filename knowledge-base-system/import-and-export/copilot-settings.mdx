### Knowledge Base

Connect one or more **Knowledge Bases** as data sources:

*   If you’ve already set up a KB for Chat, it will be pre-selected here.
    
*   If you choose a different KB than what’s shown in Chat, a confirmation message will appear:  
      
    _"It seems you are displaying a different knowledge base in Chat. Are you sure you don’t want to keep it the same?"  
    _
    
*   Don’t have a knowledge base yet? Click **New Knowledge Base** to create one.
