In this article, we will learn about how to share Knowledge Base (KB) articles—or specific sections of them during a chat conversation. This feature provides targeted information to customers quickly and efficiently, improving the overall customer experience. Whether sharing a full article or highlighting a specific section, this guide outlines the process step-by-step. Within chat, articles can be shared in two ways:

- **Entire Article:** Share the complete content of an article.

- **Specific Section:** Share a particular section or heading within the article.

This ensures customers receive targeted information based on their needs.
