title: "Share Articles in Chat"
---

In this article, we’ll learn how to share **Knowledge Base (KB)** articles or specific sections of them during a chat conversation.  

This feature provides targeted information to customers quickly and efficiently, improving the overall customer experience. Whether sharing a full article or highlighting a specific section, this guide outlines the process step-by-step.

Within chat, articles can be shared in two ways:

- **Entire Article:** Share the complete content of an article.  
- **Specific Section:** Share a particular section or heading within the article.

This ensures customers receive targeted information based on their needs.
