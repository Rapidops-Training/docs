The **"Import Article"** feature allows users to easily import articles from external sources like Intercom, Zendesk, and HubSpot into the Salesmate knowledge base. This feature simplifies the migration process and ensures that your knowledge base remains comprehensive and up-to-date.

- If there are multiple knowledge bases, you will be able to select one. The default selection will be the knowledge base from which you came.
- Choose the language for the articles you are importing. If only one language is available, it will be pre-selected and shown as disabled. For multiple languages, the default will be the **primary language**.

- If any required columns are missing from the CSV file, an error will appear:  
  **“The file is missing some required values. Review sample file.”**
- Click on **Next** to map the columns from your CSV file to the corresponding fields in the knowledge base.
- The fields **Slug,** **Title,** **Category,** and **Body** are the required fields that you will need to map.

  - **Visibility**: Public
  - **Co-pilot**: True
  - **Autopilot**: False
  - **Comments**: False

- Click on **Next** after mapping the columns to proceed to the final step.
- Choose whether to import the articles as **Drafts** or publish them immediately (the default is **Draft**).
- **Duplication Check:** The system will check for duplicates based on the **Slug** field.
- Choose how to handle duplicate articles:

  - **Skip**: Skip importing existing articles.
  - **Overwrite**: Replace existing articles with the imported ones.
