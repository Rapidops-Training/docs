In this article, we will learn about how to view Knowledge Base articles directly from the Messenger widget. Once the Article space is enabled, visitors and contacts can seamlessly access published articles within their chat experience, creating a self-service help center environment.

Once you have enabled the Article space within your chat widget, the articles published within your knowledge base will become visible to your contacts. The published articles are shown within the Article tab on the chat screen. This guide will help you understand how the articles tab will preview on your customer's end.
