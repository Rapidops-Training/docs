#### What is a Knowledge Base?

The Knowledge Base is a self-service support system in Salesmate that allows you to create and organize helpful articles, guides, and FAQs. It empowers your customers and internal team to find answers quickly without needing to contact support, improving the overall user experience and reducing support load.

#### What are the primary benefits?

Using the Knowledge Base helps reduce repetitive support tickets, speeds up resolution time, and enhances customer satisfaction. It serves as a centralized resource that your support, sales, and onboarding teams can use to assist both customers and teammates efficiently. It also improves internal knowledge sharing and consistency.

#### Which plans include the Knowledge Base?

The Knowledge Base feature is available on the Pro plan and higher. Legacy plans do not include this feature. If you reach your plan's article limit, you can purchase additional Knowledge Base access for $30/month/account to continue expanding your content repository.

#### Can I have multiple Knowledge Bases in one account?

Yes, Salesmate allows you to create and manage multiple Knowledge Bases under a single account. This is helpful if you serve multiple brands, products, or languages. Each Knowledge Base can have its own categories, articles, branding, and visibility settings for better segmentation and control.

#### What permissions are required to manage Knowledge Base content?

Salesmate offers detailed role-based permissions. You can control who can create, view, edit, delete, or publish articles. Separate permissions are available for managing categories, exporting/importing content, and handling multilingual versions. This ensures the right users have access based on their roles and responsibilities.

#### Are there any content limits in articles?

Yes. Article titles can have up to 150 characters. The article body supports up to 3,000 characters. You can also attach up to 10 files, each up to 20 MB. These limits ensure fast loading and compatibility across browsers and devices.

#### What visibility settings are available for articles?

There are three visibility options:

*   Public: Visible to anyone with the link.
*   Internal: Visible only to logged-in Salesmate team users.
*   Restricted: Visible to specific contacts or audiences based on rules like location or user type.

#### Can I attach files or documents to articles?

Yes. You can attach up to 10 documents such as PDFs, PPTs, Word files, Excel sheets, or CSV files. These files can be downloaded by users and used to provide additional resources like templates, forms, or guides related to the article's content.

#### Can the Knowledge Base be used in bot flows?

Yes. You can use the “Search Knowledge Base” action in Execution Flows for AI bots. It allows bots like Sandy to search articles and return relevant answers automatically when users ask common questions in chat.

#### What formats do attachments support?

PDF, DOCX, PPT, XLS, CSV, and likely PNG/JPG.

#### What analytics are available?

Insight reports include searches with no results, total searches, feedback (like/dislike), time spent, clicks, and top searches.

#### What is the Search KB action?

A bot flow step that retrieves answers from KB using predefined questions or user inputs.

#### How can I restrict a Knowledge Base to specific logged-in contacts only?

Use the “Restricted” visibility option and configure access rules based on contact attributes like location, tags, or custom fields to ensure only certain users can view articles.

#### Can I embed videos or GIFs directly into articles?

Yes. The editor supports video and GIF embedding using upload or iframe options from services like YouTube, Loom, or Giphy.
