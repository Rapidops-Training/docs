The **Searches with No Results** report gives you an idea of how often users search for terms in the knowledge base that return no articles. This helps identify content gaps and opportunities to create new or improve existing articles.

The report logs each instance when a visitor or contact searches for a term and the search does not return any relevant results, allowing you to pinpoint missing or unclear content areas.

*   The data is displayed as a grid, offering a structured view of unsuccessful search attempts.
*   **Search Term:** The keyword or phrase entered by the user during a search.
*   **Total Searches with No Results:** The number of times this search term did not return any articles.
*   The report utilizes the number of failed searches as the metric to determine content gaps.
*   The report will automatically show data for the last 30 days, and you can change this range.
*   There is a **drill-down capability** so that you can click on the search term to explore deeper insights or identify patterns in user intent.
*   Add this report to your dashboard by clicking on the [Add widget](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/360049849771-Manage-widgets-and-filters) and choosing the **system or Knowledge Base** filter on the left panel then selecting the report and clicking on the **Add to Dashboard** option.
*   **Date Range:** Adjust the time frame to analyze click activity over a specific period.
