### AI Pilot and AI Copilot Dependency

If the knowledge base is actively used in **AI Pilot** or **AI Copilot**, you will see a warning message during deletion: "Are you sure you want to delete this knowledge base? Deleting it may result in feature failures."

### Data That Will Be Permanently Deleted

Deleting a knowledge base will remove all of the following:

*   Articles
    
*   Categories
    
*   Sub-categories
    
*   Article statistics and performance data
    
*   Knowledge base visibility in chat and Messenger layout
    
*   Copilot and AI Pilot configurations tied to this knowledge base
    

If this knowledge base were configured for display in chat, the **Article** section would be removed from the Messenger layout automatically. The toggle button will also switch off.
