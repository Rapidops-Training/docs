**Companies** are nothing more than **commercial entities connected to the contacts** a Skara works with. Any Company's information page will include all Contact associated with that company as well as any notes or actions associated with any Contact or Deal associated with that company.

- Multiple contacts can be associated with a company.
- Organizations are profiles holding long-term information, e.g., company websites and addresses.

<Note>
