- **Companies** are nothing more than **commercial entities connected to the contacts** a salesman works with. Any Company's information page will include all Contact associated with that company as well as any notes, activities, or actions associated with any Contact or Deal associated with that company.

* Multiple contacts can be associated with a company.

* **Companies can also be associated with** Activities and

* **Deals**.

* Organizations are profiles holding long-term information, e.g., company websites and addresses.

- ** Having duplicate data could be painful, so to avoid them Salesmate provides with duplicate management solution to ensure no duplicate data is been added to the CRM.

- Now, company duplication is not only checked while importing but also when you are creating a new company.
