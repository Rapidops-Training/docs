**No Google Contact Sync. No Worries, it's a boon in disguise.**Salesmate allows each user to import their Google Contacts. It can thus create duplicates records, yet this can be avoided checking the duplicate records based on the email address. However, yet who should be Contact Owner? One contact can belong to multiple users in an organization. Thus to avoid any conflict of interests and data redundancy Salesmate currently does not offer Google Contact Sync.

If you think Google Contact Sync is what you need we have an alternative for you. Configure a Zap (zapier.com) OR configure [Piesync Contact Sync](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/115001622612-Contact-Sync-Piesync-Integration) to create/update a Google contact as it gets added to Salesmate.

* **Click on "** Make a Zap "

* **Select** Trigger

* **App**: Google Contacts

* **Select** Action App : Salesmate

* **Select** Salesmate Action : Create a Contact

* **Test this and you are good to push your Google contacts to Salesmate** Note: You can also set this Zap the other way round, i.e. Pushing your Salesmate contacts to Google Contacts via Zapier.
