A contact is eliminated from the list when we delete it. It indicates that we are unable to view that person in our list of contacts any longer.

There are numerous methods for deleting records in Salesmate. The most effective method typically depends on how many records you need to delete or which specific set of information has to be deleted.

<Note>
  **Note:**When we delete a contact, it gets moved to the deleted records under
  the Setup >> Deleted Records. The data stays there for 30 days, you can
  recover the deleted records during this time. Post that it is deleted
  permanently. The contact would be unenrolled from the Sequence and the
  Automation when deleted.
