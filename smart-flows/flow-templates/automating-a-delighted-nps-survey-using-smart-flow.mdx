### Key Features of Flow


***Timed Feedback Collection:**Sends NPS surveys 30 days post-onboarding for timely insights into customer satisfaction.

***Data Integration:**Updates external systems via API calls for seamless feedback management.

***Custom Branching:**Adjusts workflows based on customer feedback, enhancing retention strategies.

### Flow Process Breakdown**Trigger: [Record Creation](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/36763966875289-Record-Created) (Contact)*****Description:**The flow is triggered automatically when a new contact is created. This process initiates an NPS survey 30 days after the contact’s creation, allowing for a timely and systematic collection of customer feedback.

***Practical Use Case:**For instance, after a new customer is added to the system, the flow waits for 30 days to assess their satisfaction level through the NPS survey.

![](./Automating a Delighted NPS Survey Using Smart Flow – Salesmate_files/mceclip0.png)**Action 1: [Wait](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/38138356545433-Wait) - 30 Days*****Description:**This step introduces a 30-day waiting period post-contact creation. The delay ensures that customers have had enough time to experience the service, resulting in more accurate and meaningful feedback for the NPS survey.

***Practical Use Case:**After the customer is added, the flow pauses for 30 days, allowing the customer to engage with the service before the survey is sent.

![](./Automating a Delighted NPS Survey Using Smart Flow – Salesmate_files/mceclip1.png)**Condition 1: [Branch](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/37780627045657-Branch) (Check Customer Status)*****Description:**This condition checks if the contact is marked as an Outbound Prospect. If the customer is not an Outbound Prospect, the flow continues, ensuring that only qualified contacts proceed with further actions or campaigns.

***Practical Use Case:**For instance, if the contact is a lead from an outbound campaign, the flow ensures that they are not included in the NPS survey until they qualify as a customer.

![](./Automating a Delighted NPS Survey Using Smart Flow – Salesmate_files/mceclip2.png)**Condition 2: [Is in a List](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/37780752141209-Is-in-List) (Check NPS Survey List)*****Description:**This step verifies whether the contact is part of the NPS survey list. If the contact is listed, they are eligible for the survey; otherwise, the flow takes alternative actions like creating a task to check eligibility.

***Practical Use Case:**For example, contacts who are in the NPS survey list are automatically sent the survey, while others are added to a task list for follow-up.

![](./Automating a Delighted NPS Survey Using Smart Flow – Salesmate_files/mceclip3.png)**Action 2: [API Call/Webhook](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/38138525618969-API-Call-Webhook) (Send to Delight for Paid Clients)*****Description:**This action uses an API call or webhook to send paid clients to the "Delight" stage. Here, they receive personalized content and engagement that enhance their experience, promoting long-term loyalty.

***Practical Use Case:**For example, once a paid client completes the NPS survey, they receive tailored engagement that reflects their customer status, improving their overall satisfaction.

This ensures that those who have completed the survey are tracked for any follow-up actions.

***Practical Use Case:**After a customer completes the NPS survey, they are automatically added to the "NPS Survey Done" list for record-keeping and follow-up tasks.


### Break Up of Items Used in The Flow**Trigger***   This flow is automatically triggered when a new contact is created. After 30 days, an NPS survey is initiated to assess customer satisfaction.


####**Wait***   Following the contact creation, the flow enters a 30-day waiting period before proceeding with the NPS survey.


####**Branching**At this stage, the flow splits into two paths based on specific conditions:


*   *   The first branch checks if the contact type is "Customer" and does**not**have the tag "Outbound Prospect."
    *   If the conditions are met, the flow continues as intended. Otherwise, an alternate course of action is followed (Exit Flow).


####**Condition*****Is in List**: The system verifies whether the contact is included in the NPS list.**If False**– An activity is created for the user to review the customer’s eligibility for the NPS survey.**If True**– A webhook is triggered to send the NPS survey via Delighted.


####**Action*****API Call/Webhook**– Qualified paid clients are moved to the "Delight" stage, where they receive personalized engagement and content to enhance their experience and drive long-term loyalty.**Webhook URL:**[https://api.delightsurvey.com/webhooks/feedback](https://api.delightsurvey.com/webhooks/feedback)
