- *Action 1: [Record Create](#key-features-of-flow-automated-ticket-creation-instantly-generates-tickets-when-a-web-form-or-request-is-submitted) (Ticket)**- **Description:** The flow creates a new ticket using the data from the submitted form. This ensures that a formal ticket record is created in the system for tracking and resolution.

- **Practical Use Case:** A customer submits a support form reporting a login issue. The workflow **automatically creates a ticket**, ensuring the issue is logged and assigned for resolution without manual intervention.

- * Condition: [Branch](#key-features-of-flow-automated-ticket-creation-instantly-generates-tickets-when-a-web-form-or-request-is-submitted) (Priority Categories)**Description:** The ticket is evaluated based on the data, such as priority or urgency, and is divided into one of three categories:**Low**,**Medium**, or **High** priority.

- **Practical Use Case:**For instance, urgent tickets related to critical system issues are categorized as **High**, while less time-sensitive inquiries are categorized as ** Low **.

- *Action 2: [A/B Split](#flow-process-breakdown-triggerform-submissionhttpssupportsalesmateiohcen-usarticles37775479211289-form-submitted-description-the-flow-is-triggered-when-a-form-is-submitted-indicating-the-creation-of-a-new-support-ticket-this-initial-step-captures-all-relevant-form-data-and-prepares-it-for-processing) (Team Assignment)**- **Description:** The flow divides the tickets into different teams based on their priority category. Each priority group (Low, Medium, High) is assigned to the appropriate team based on their workload or expertise.

- **Practical Use Case:** High-priority tickets might be assigned to senior agents or specialists, while low-priority tickets can be handled by general support staff.

###  Break Up of Items Used in The Flow **Trigger** When a contact submits a form that generates a ticket, they are automatically enrolled in the Smart Flow.

- **Action**### **Find Records**– This step identifies the specific contact who submitted the ticket, ensuring proper attribution. The system searches for a matching email address where **Email = Form Data Email**, retrieving only the first record found.

### **Create a Record**– A new ticket is generated based on the submitted form data. Predefined ticket attributes such as **Subject, Type, Stage, Priority, Contact, and Description** are assigned accordingly.

- **Branching** The flow diverges into multiple paths based on **ticket priority**, categorized as **High, Medium, Low, and Urgent**.

- ** Actions **A/B Split**– Tickets are distributed proportionally based on priority, following a 50/50 allocation within each priority category.

- **Update Record**– After the A/B split, the flow proceeds to update ticket ownership and assign relevant criteria based on the ticket's priority level.
