### How contact quota is utilized for Automation Journeys and Smart flow

Automation Journeys consume your contact quota based on the number of unique contacts triggered within a billing cycle. If you have a paid subscription for Automation Journeys, Smart Flows will share the same contact quota.**For example**:

- If you purchased a quota of 1,000 contacts.

- 100 unique contacts are triggered via Smart Flows.

- 100 unique contacts are triggered via Automation Journeys.

Your total usage would be 200 contacts, leaving 800 contacts remaining from your Automation Journeys quota. [Learn more about how Automation Journeys Pricing are calculated](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/360061933432-How-automation-journey-prices-are-calculated)
