### Practical Example


*   You want to send series of emails to the leads who show interest in a particular product or service. These leads can come from multiple sources, E.g., Inquiry form from the website, Facebook Lead, or interest shown over the chat. And these sources might change with time. So you don't want to keep updating your automation journey.

*   In such cases, you can use the "Added to list" trigger. So, whenever there is a new lead, you can automatically or manually add that contact to the selected list, and it will flow through the automation journey.
