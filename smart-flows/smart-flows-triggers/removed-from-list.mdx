###  Practical Example

The "Removed from List" trigger is valuable for responding to changes in a contact's preferences. For example, contacts can be automatically or manually removed from a list if they opt out of an email campaign or cancel their subscription. By setting up a Smart Flow that triggers when a contact is removed from a list, you can automatically tag the contact for follow-up, assign them to another list, or plan future outreach to re-engage them.
