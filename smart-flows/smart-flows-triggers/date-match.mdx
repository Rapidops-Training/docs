###  Practical Example

Here, we are managing a subscription-based service, and we want to send a renewal reminder email to customers a week before their subscription expires.

With this setup, every day, the system will check for subscriptions that are set to expire in one week. When a match is found, customers will receive a timely reminder, helping to improve renewal rates and customer satisfaction.
