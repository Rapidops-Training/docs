### Practical Example

As a manager, review recent conversations with high-value accounts. If a salesperson hasn’t added a note for their last conversation with a client, add a “Pending Note” tag to the record.This tag assigns a to-do to the record owner, reminding them to add the conversation note.Once the salesperson adds the note, the tag is automatically removed.An email summary is then sent to you to confirm the update details.
