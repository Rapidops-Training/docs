###  Practical Example

For example, if you want to send an automated email to new customers whenever a new lead is added, you can set up a trigger for this action. You can also do the same for existing leads. Additionally, once the email is sent, you can automatically add a tag called "Welcome Sent" to keep track of those who have received the email.
