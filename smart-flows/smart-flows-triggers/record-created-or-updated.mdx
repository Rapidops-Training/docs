  **\*Description:**Enter a brief explanation of what the trigger does and its role in the flow.
  **\*Module:**Select the specific module where the trigger should be applied.

<Note>
  **Note:** If you want to execute the smart flow based on a specific field
  update, you can include that field in the enrollment condition and apply the
  **'Is change'** condition.
</Note>

### Practical Example

For example, if you want to send an automated email to new customers whenever a new lead is added, you can set up a trigger for this action. You can also do the same for existing leads. Additionally, once the email is sent, you can automatically add a tag called "Welcome Sent" to keep track of those who have received the email.
