With the trigger-based smart flow, you can automate your marketing and sales processes by incorporating various triggers and actions.

You can set your trigger criteria to automatically enroll records like contacts, companies, deals, and activities into the flow. This allows you to take actions on primary or associated records (e.g., updating the contact linked to a deal) that are part of the flow.**Topics Covered:***   [How to Create a Trigger based Smart Flow](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/37578402656281-Working-with-Trigger-Based-Smart-Flows#h_01JCFSQTZPS4XNFBB5WWTATDQ8)

###**Practical Example**When a new subscriber signs up on your website, an automated welcome email is sent to thank them and introduce your services. A tag, such as "New Subscriber," is added to their profile for future segmentation. Additionally, a follow-up email with helpful resources or a special offer is scheduled to be sent a week later. This kind of flow helps engage new subscribers and increases the likelihood of conversion.
