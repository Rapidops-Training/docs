- Select the **Flow Type** from the following options,
* **Trigger-Based Flow:** The flow activates automatically when a record is created, updated, or deleted.
* **Sub Flow:** The flow will be initiated when it is invoked by another flow.
* **Manual Flow:** The flow is initiated manually by a user.

- After selecting this option, you'll be directed to the next step, where you'll need to provide additional information.

- If you select **Sub Flow,** you'll need to choose the execution method:

* **Synchronous Execution:** Select this method when you want to utilize the output of this flow in the invoking flow. It can’t have any sort of wait steps.
* **Asynchronous execution:** Select this method when you have a few common steps you want to call out in different flows. This supports ‘wait’ steps like sending an email and waiting for a reply before executing the next step.
