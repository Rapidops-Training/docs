After selecting this option, you'll be directed to the next step, where you'll need to provide additional information.If you select **Sub Flow,** you'll need to choose the execution method:- **Synchronous Execution:** Select this method when you want to utilize the output of this flow in the invoking flow. It can’t have any sort of wait steps.

- **Asynchronous execution:** Select this method when you have a few common steps you want to call out in different flows. This supports ‘wait’ steps like sending an email and waiting for a reply before executing the next step.
