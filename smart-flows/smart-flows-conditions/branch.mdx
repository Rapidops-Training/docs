### Practical Example

With the "Branch" condition, you can route web form submissions based on contact location. For instance, when a form is submitted and contacts are from different countries, the branch condition directs them to the appropriate team based on their country. This ensures each contact is assigned to the most relevant regional team, enhancing response accuracy and efficiency.
