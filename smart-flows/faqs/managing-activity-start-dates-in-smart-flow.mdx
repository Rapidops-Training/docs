####**How to Set the Start Date of an Activity in Smart Flow** You can customize the **Start Date** of an activity using either the **Assign interaction** or the **Data Operation interaction** in Smart Flow. Below are the detailed steps for both methods:**Method 1: Using the Assign Interaction **Select a Trigger** Choose a trigger based on your requirement.Example: Trigger the Smart Flow when a new contact is created in Salesmate.

- **Create a Variable** Create a variable of type** Date & Time **. Refer to this for guidance on [creating variables](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/36669777739417).Since the Start Date field is of type Date & Time, this variable will be used for calculations.
