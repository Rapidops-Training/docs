- *List**: Choose a single list to which the contact(s) will be added

###  Practical example:

When a customer signs up through your website or a mobile app, the system automatically identifies the chosen plan and assigns the customer to the particular list.This approach allows your marketing team to tailor communications and promotional efforts specific to each subscription type, ensuring relevant messaging and enhancing customer engagement.
