### Practical Example:

Here, we will use**OpenAI**to extract key data from incoming leads sourced from various channels. Based on the extracted**industry information**, leads will be assigned to the appropriate sales representatives. This automation ensures**efficient lead distribution**, minimizes manual effort, and improves response time.**Step 1: Extract Contact Details**When a new lead is received, OpenAI will extract essential details, such as:**Name**– Helps personalize outreach.**Email**– Used for communication and follow-ups.**Company Name**– Provides business context for lead qualification.**LinkedIn URL**– Helps reps gather more insights before reaching out.**Step 2: Identify Industry Using OpenAI**OpenAI will analyze the extracted information (e.g., company name and LinkedIn URL) to determine the**industry type**of the lead.This ensures that each lead is categorized correctly without manual input.**Step 3: Assign Leads Based on Industry**Using**Branching Logic**, leads will be automatically assigned to the**right sales representative**based on the industry type.Example:
Leads from the**Tech Industry**→ Assigned to Rep A.Leads from the**Healthcare Industry**→ Assigned to Rep B.Leads from the**Finance Industry**→ Assigned to Rep C.

This automated workflow**saves time, improves accuracy, and ensures that each lead reaches the most suitable sales rep**for a higher chance of conversion.
