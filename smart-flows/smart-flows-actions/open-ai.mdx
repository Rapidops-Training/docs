###  Practical Example:

Here, we will use **OpenAI** to extract key data from incoming leads sourced from various channels. Based on the extracted **industry information**, leads will be assigned to the appropriate sales representatives. This automation ensures **efficient lead distribution**, minimizes manual effort, and improves response time.

- **Step 1: Extract Contact Details** When a new lead is received, OpenAI will extract essential details, such as:**Name**– Helps personalize outreach.

- **Email**– Used for communication and follow-ups.

- **Company Name**– Provides business context for lead qualification.

- **LinkedIn URL**– Helps reps gather more insights before reaching out.

- **Step 2: Identify Industry Using OpenAI** OpenAI will analyze the extracted information (e.g., company name and LinkedIn URL) to determine the **industry type** of the lead.This ensures that each lead is categorized correctly without manual input.

- **Step 3: Assign Leads Based on Industry** Using **Branching Logic**, leads will be automatically assigned to the **right sales representative** based on the industry type.Example:
Leads from the **Tech Industry**→ Assigned to Rep A.Leads from the **Healthcare Industry**→ Assigned to Rep B.Leads from the **Finance Industry**→ Assigned to Rep C.

This automated workflow **saves time, improves accuracy, and ensures that each lead reaches the most suitable sales rep** for a higher chance of conversion.
