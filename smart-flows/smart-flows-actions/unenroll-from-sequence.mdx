###  Practical Example

Considering a use case where you have a **Prospecting Sequence** for Qualifying a lead for Sales.The Smart Flow will allow you to unenroll contact from this sequence when a **Deal's Pipeline** is changed from **Prospect to Sales** automatically. This will allow you to ensure no further Prospecting E-mails are sent to a record as soon as they are Qualified for Sales.You can configure a flow and use this action "**Unenroll from sequence**" which executes on "**Deal Stage Match**" Added". Select the Stage on "Deal Stage Match" trigger to ensure the record is removed from the sequence when it is moved to that specific Stage/Pipeline and configure it to "Unenroll from Sequence" action.
