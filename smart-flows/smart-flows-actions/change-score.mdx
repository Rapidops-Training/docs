### Use Cases

### Increase score when someone clicks a specific link from the email

Scoring the leads who interact with our emails can give us a better idea about their interest in our products and services. E.g., If a lead has clicked on the pricing page link from the welcome email, they are probably more serious in evaluating our product.  Here we increase their score by 5 points with a depreciating duration of 30 days. As if someone has visited a pricing page before 30 days might not as hot lead as someone has just visited the page.

### Increase score when someone downloads an ebook

Start the automation journey when a contact downloads an ebook. So we can configure a push event to Salesmate whenever an ebook gets downloaded from the website. This way, we can score contacts based on their interaction with the site.

### Decrease score when someone unsubscribes from your emails

Lead nurturing campaigns are an excellent way to educate your customer about your services and product via a sequence of emails. But if someone unsubscribes from your campaign, then they are probably less interested in your offerings. Over here, we decrease the lead score by 10 points when they unsubscribe from emails.
