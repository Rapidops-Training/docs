Salesmate offers long code numbers. SMS pricing is based on the **destination** and **type** of message you’re sending, as well as the **carrier** to which the SMS is being sent. Our pay-as-you-go pricing gives you a fair price for A2P 10DLC no matter what your location is.

Rates for widely used messaging locations are as below. In case you need rates for any other locations, feel free to get in touch with us at [support@salesmate.io](mailto:support@salesmate.io) OR reach out to us over chat.

**†**Text messages are charged per segment and include carrier charges for USA & Canada. 

**‡**Price may vary based on the carrier to which the SMS is being sent.

\*Single SMS equals <= 160 characters including spaces and/or any special characters.

\* Prices are subject to change without prior notice. We try our best to inform prior in case of any changes. However, it is best to verify the rates as applied in your Logs in Salesmate.

\* We charge you at standard rates while you send out / schedule a campaign and later update the charges as received by our provider. Thus, it is always advisable to keep sufficient balance to avoid suspension of the account. Any or all pending amounts are liable to be paid and will be charged to the card on file. 

\* While you are not registered / in progress under A2P10DLC you will be charged a penalty fee which could be almost double the above charges. These are charged as received from the providers.

\* There will be a complete block on messaging if you are not registered under A2P10DLC w.e.f. 31st Aug 2023. 

<Note>
**Note:**

*   Single SMS (one segment) consists of 160 characters including spaces.
*   A2P 10DLC is applicable for all numbers offered by Salesmate in the United states to allow to send Application-to-Person (A2P) type messaging via standard 10-digit long code (10DLC) phone numbers.
*   This system is specific to long code messaging toward the United States and does not affect shortcodes or Toll-Free numbers sending to the US.
