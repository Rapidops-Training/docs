### Important notes

- Prices are subject to change without prior notice. We try our best to inform you of changes in advance, but we recommend verifying the effective rates in your Salesmate Logs before sending large volumes.  
- We charge standard rates when you send/schedule a campaign and later adjust charges as received from our provider. Keep sufficient balance to avoid account suspension. Any pending amounts are liable to be paid and may be charged to the card on file.  
- If you are not registered (or registration is in progress) under A2P 10DLC, you may incur penalty fees which can be substantially higher than the standard rates — these penalties are charged as received from providers.  
- There may be a complete block on long-code messaging if you are not registered under A2P 10DLC starting **August 31, 2023** (date shown for reference).

### About A2P 10DLC

`A2P 10DLC` applies to numbers offered by Salesmate in the United States to allow Application-to-Person (A2P) messaging via standard 10-digit long code (10DLC) phone numbers. This system is specific to long-code messaging toward the United States and does **not** affect short codes or Toll-Free numbers sending to the US.
