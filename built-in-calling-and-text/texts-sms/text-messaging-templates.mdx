####**Note :**You can select a template at the time of sending a single text message or a bulk one.If a single text message is being sent, and as soon as you choose the template, it will replace all variables with the related module and replace the text message body with a written one. Even users can type a variable after selecting a template inside the message and that should be parsed before sending the message.If you are sending the bulk message, then variables will not be replaced while selecting a template, and they will be replaced at the time of sending the messageThe template count will be increased with each send.
