The character limit for a single SMS message is **160 characters**, however, most modern phones and networks support concatenation and segment and rebuild messages up to 1600 characters.

When you send an SMS over 160 characters the message will be split.  Large messages are segmented into 153 character segments and sent individually then rebuilt by the recipient's device. For example, a 161-character message will be sent as two messages, one with 153 characters and the second with 8 characters.

So it’s good financial discipline, as well as good SMS etiquette, to keep the message down to 160 characters. But it’s good to know that if you need to, you can send quite large text messages.

We recommend you check any mass messages in [this tool](http://chadselph.github.io/smssplit/) before you send them out.

#### **Note:**

*   The use of special characters could cause the SMS to be split further and sent as separate messages. Try and maintain your messages to be in plain text.
*   If you are using variables inside your templates, the actual character length can change at the time of sending the message.
*   As per the CTIA Messaging principles and Best Practices, we recommend sending messages to no more than 200 unique recipients per day from a number at a rate of no more than 15 - 60 messages per minute, to avoid possible carrier end filtering.
