As part of the phone industry’s efforts to combat spam and improve the delivery of legitimate text messages, organizations that send text messages to US ten-digit phone numbers are required to register the phone numbers that they are using for their SMS messaging campaigns.

Ensure delivery of your text message by registering your SMS campaign with an [A2P trust vendor.](https://www.campaignregistry.com/) 

Such registries use standard ten-digit phone numbers (also known as 10DLC) as part of an industry-wide effort to reduce unwanted text messages. All major communications service providers, including Twilio and DialPad, are members of such trust vendors.

**A2P 10DLC Vetting Delays:** A2P 10DLC registration currently takes at least 3 weeks or more due to higher than normal volume of requests. Campaign submissions initiated at this time will most likely not be available before the August 31, 2023 A2P registration deadline.

### A2P 10DLC Brand Selection and Registration

*   **Only Business Profile (Sole Proprietor)** **Registration**($4 one-time fee)  
    *   Customers sending fewer than 3,000 message segments per day to U.S. destinations are now required to complete A2P registration for each of their phone numbers. Messages sent with unregistered phone numbers are now incurring additional per-message carrier fees and may be subject to filtering or blocking.

*   **Standard Brand with secondary vetting**($44 one-time fee)
    *   Secondary vetting is an additional brand review done by carriers that allows for higher daily message limits and maximizes throughput per campaign. The process ensures accuracy of information and maximizes your [Trust Score](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/1260803225669-Message-throughput-MPS-and-Trust-Scores-for-A2P-10DLC-in-the-US), with no additional time for approval. 
*   **Standard Brand without secondary vetting** ($4 one-time fee instead of $44 )
    *   By skipping secondary vetting, you will not receive a TCR score, and will be limited to register campaigns with a limited set of use cases (To send under 6,000 message segments per day). Skip secondary vetting only after you have reviewed [this document](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403988619163-Secondary-Vetting-for-A2P-10DLC#h_01FF67VWCZF0R7P1KRECZ9PPR1), and understand the implications.

**Note**: Based on the option submitted. This fees will be directly deducted from your Salesmate Voice Credits. 

  

### SMS campaign use cases within the ecosystem.

We will be submitting this information to carriers so they understand what type of messages you’ll be sending. **Each A2P Campaign use case registration fee is $15 (a one\-time registration fee at the time of vetting). In addition, carriers charge a monthly fee ranging from $1.5 to $10, depending on your campaign use case.** Declaring your exact campaign use case rather than using a mixed campaign use case will generally result in higher limits from AT&T because you're being more specific about what messages you are sending.
