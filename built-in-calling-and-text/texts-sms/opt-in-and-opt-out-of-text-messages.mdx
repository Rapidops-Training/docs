They can opt-out by sending any of the following (case-insensitive) keywords in response to your text message:** STOP **STOP ALL **UNSUBSCRIBE **CANCEL **END **QUIT ** These easy-to-use keywords give users the flexibility to stop unwanted messages and regain control over their communication preferences.

### **How the Opt-Out Process Works** Once a contact opts out, the system will automatically update their preferences across your account:**Contact Information Update**: The phone number that sent the opt-out request will be marked as unsubscribed in your contacts list. A timeline entry will also be created for reference.

- **Skipped Bulk Text Messages**: Any future bulk text messages will be skipped for this contact, and the failure message will read:**"Unsubscribed from Text"**.

- **Sequences**: If the contact is part of any automated sequence with text steps, they will automatically be skipped from receiving text messages in that sequence.

- **Text Message Status**: If a contact in automation has opted out of receiving text messages, the system will note the attempt as **unsuccessful** and label it as:**"Text Unsubscribed"**.

### **Re-Opting In: How Contacts Can Start Receiving Text Messages Again** If a contact changes their mind and wants to start receiving text messages again, they can easily opt back in by sending any of the following keywords:** START **UNSTOP **SUBSCRIBE ** This simple process allows contacts to re-engage with your messages whenever they choose, ensuring flexibility and control over their communication preferences.

### **Why This Matters** Giving your contacts the ability to opt-out or opt-in to text messages is not only about respecting their preferences but also about staying compliant with legal requirements. With this feature, Salesmate helps you create a more transparent, user-friendly experience that strengthens your relationship with customers while maintaining compliance with communication regulations.
