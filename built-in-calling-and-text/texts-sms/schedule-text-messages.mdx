<Note>


**Note**:

*   Salesmate voice and text should be enabled
*   Ensure the phone number is in the correct format to ensure proper delivery.
*   If you are using variables inside your templates, the actual character length can change at the time of sending the message.
*   If a text message is fired from the deal then it will get auto-attached to the deal too. You can send from the deal detail page, deal's listing grid, or deals listing grid using bulk message. It will also replace deal variables inside the text body.
