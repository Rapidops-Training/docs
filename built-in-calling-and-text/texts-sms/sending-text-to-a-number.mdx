Keep Note of the Character CountSimilar operations can be performed for other modules **Note:**The character limit for a single SMS message is **160** characters, however, most modern phones and networks support concatenation and segment and rebuild messages up to 1600 characters. Messages not using [GSM-7](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-is-gsm-7-character-encoding) encoding are limited to 67 characters.When you send an SMS message over 160 characters the message will be split. Large messages are segmented into 153 character segments and sent individually then rebuilt by the recipient's device. For example, a 161 character message will be sent as two messages, one with 153 characters and the second with 8 characters.

Hit **Send** to send the Text messageOn success, we will put a message in the **Outbox to be sent** If any error occurs then an error message will be displayedThis message can be seen in the **Failed** folderThe user will be given a notification about "Sending Failed" with a detailed reason about why it failed (Cases: Low Balance, Wrong Number, etc.)

Salesmate voice and text should be enabledEnsure the phone number is in the correct format to ensure proper delivery.If you are using variables inside your templates, actual character length can change at the time of sending the message.If a text message is fired from the deal then it will get auto attached to the deal too. You can send from deal detail page, deal's listing grid, or deals listing grid using bulk message. It will also replace deal variables inside the text body.
