*   Keep Note of the Character Count
*   Similar operations can be performed for other modules

<Note>


**Note:**

The character limit for a single SMS message is **160** characters, however, most modern phones and networks support concatenation and segment and rebuild messages up to 1600 characters.  Messages not using [GSM-7](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-is-gsm-7-character-encoding) encoding are limited to 67 characters.

When you send an SMS message over 160 characters the message will be split. Large messages are segmented into 153 character segments and sent individually then rebuilt by the recipient's device. For example, a 161 character message will be sent as two messages, one with 153 characters and the second with 8 characters.


</Note>

*   Hit **Send** to send the Text message
*   On success, we will put a message in the **Outbox to be sent**
*   If any error occurs then an error message will be displayed
*   This message can be seen in the **Failed** folder
*   The user will be given a notification about "Sending Failed" with a detailed reason about why it failed (Cases: Low Balance, Wrong Number, etc.)

### How to Schedule Text Messages

*   Hit **Schedule** to Schedule sending the message
*   You can select date and time and hit the Schedule button
*   Messages will land inside **S****chedule** Folder and sent at the particular Date and Time
*   In case of an error, then the user will be notified about sending failure.

**Note**:

*   Salesmate voice and text should be enabled
*   Ensure the phone number is in the correct format to ensure proper delivery.
*   If you are using variables inside your templates, actual character length can change at the time of sending the message.
*   If a text message is fired from the deal then it will get auto attached to the deal too. You can send from deal detail page, deal's listing grid, or deals listing grid using bulk message. It will also replace deal variables inside the text body.
