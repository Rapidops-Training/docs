**What do you need to know?**

Due to updated regulations to combat fraud, all SMS messages sent to Malaysia that contain any of the following content in the message body will be blocked in the near future:

*   Mobile or fixed-line phone numbers
*   Requests for a personâ€™s personal information (e.g. name, identification number, card number, bank account number, etc.)
*   URLs

Previously, customers could send SMS messages containing URLs and phone numbers if they were registered with Twilio before sending. Due to updated regulations to combat fraud, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) is now restricting the content of SMS messages sent to Malaysian mobile subscribers.

**What do you need to do?**

*   Avoid using URLs, requests for personal information, and phone numbers in the body of any SMS message to Malaysia. Messages with prohibited content will be blocked with error 30007, even if you have registered the phone number and/or URLs with Twilio.
