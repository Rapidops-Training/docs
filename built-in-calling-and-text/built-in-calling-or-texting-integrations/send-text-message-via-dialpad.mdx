To start with **Sending Text Messages via Dialpad**, a user should have an active **Dialpad account.** The logged-in user’s email is checked and if the corresponding Dialpad account is found then they can send the text.

NOTE - _Dialpad APIs don’t support attachments right now, so you can’t send MMS._

![](./Send Text Message via Dialpad – Salesmate_files/mceclip0(1).png)

- This will follow the base rules as stated here: [Send Text](https://rapidops.quip.com/C6a8A0IJWPL5)
- The action will have a tooltip: “**Send a text to the contacts via Dialpad from specified user.**”
- The differences are stated here with:
  - The link would redirect the user to the app detail page of DialPad.
  - In case the plan doesn’t support the DialPad, then user will get the upgrade popup on click of Install button.
  - Instead of From Number it will ask From User (List of Salesmate users who have active Dialpad account)
  - The texts will be sent from the Dialpad number associated with that User
  - For any reason, if the selected account is no more active then message sending will fail: “No Dialpad account found”
  - If any other error has come from Dialpad while sending the text then it will be visible with text as we do in the current system.
  - In case DialPad account is not connected, or not installed, or not supported. A message is displayed in the popup “You need an active DialPad connection to use this feature. Click here to connect.”
