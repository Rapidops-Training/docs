To send a media message, you must validate MediaUrl type when making a request to the Salesmate Programmable SMS.Salesmate checks the type of file trying to associate while texting to validate the content type of the media file. If the content-type does not match that of the media file, Salesmate will reject the request.**Topics Covered:**[Media Size Limits](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415536547353#h_01HTBZ3S6THZ258Z5GV51GV7YM)[Number of Attachments Supported](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415536547353#h_01HTBZ3S6TAW6CD75TPNPYC8X0)[Supported File Types](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/4415536547353#h_01HTBZ3S6T4VMXSX436M42TJB8)

### Media Size Limits

When you send an outbound message, the total message size must be under the maximum size limit as described below. A request with media or a collection of media larger than the size limit will fail with an error. For a media message, the maximum size limit is 5MB.

### Number of Attachments Supported

Twilio supports up to 10 MediaUrl attachments, as long as the total size of the message body text and all attachments is less than 5 MB. An MMS message body can be up to 1600 characters long, which equals 4.8KB or roughly 1% of the total size limit.If your message (including body text and media) is larger than 5 MB, your message request will fail.
