Although most numbers are portable, there are several common reasons why a port request may be initially rejected by the carrier losing the numbers. In nearly all cases, these rejections can be remedied by the rightful user of the phone number such that the port request will be able to proceed.The best way to prevent your port request from being rejected is to make sure you submit the exact information that your current carrier has on file. It’s a good idea to contact your current carrier in advance to verify this information. The surest way to reduce the likelihood of a port rejection is to obtain a Customer Service Record (CSR) from your current carrier.Below is a list of common reasons for a port request rejection:**Unsatisfactory Business Relationship**This typically means that either you have an unpaid balance or the carrier charges a port away fee.To resolve this rejection you must pay any outstanding balance/fee to your current carrier.Once this is resolved, send us an email and we will resubmit the port request.**All Data Mismatch / Name Mismatch / Address Mismatch**This means that the information you submitted on your Letter of Authorization (LOA) is different from what is on file with your carrier in their Customer Service Record (CSR). A CSR is a copy of how your telephone records appear in the telephone company’s database. In order to ensure a port request’s likely success, the information on the Letter of Authorization (LOA) – particularly the authorized user, service address, and zip code – should exactly match the information on the CSR.To resolve this rejection, contact the carrier to update your information. You may need to talk to your carrier's porting team to get a copy of the CSR for your account.Once they update your information, send us an email and we will resubmit the port request. Alternatively, send us a new LOA with the correct information.**Number is Inactive**Your numbers must be in service with the losing carrier.To resolve this rejection, contact the losing carrier to reinstate the number.Once the number is reactivated, send us an email and we will resubmit the port request.**Unauthorized Signature**This means that the person authorized to make changes on the account is not the person who signed the Letter of Authorization (LOA).To resolve this rejection, contact the carrier to update the person authorized to make changes on the account.Once they update your information, send us an email and we will resubmit the port request. Alternatively, send us a new LOA with the correct signature.**Wrong Wireless Account Pin**In order to port wireless numbers, you must submit a PIN. Please note that the PIN is sometimes the last four digits of the account holder’s Social Security Number.To resolve this rejection, contact the carrier to obtain the PIN number they have on file.Once you have the correct PIN number send us an email and we will resubmit the port request.**Incorrect / Missing Account Number**To resolve this rejection, contact your losing carrier to obtain the account number they have on file.
