Salesmate strongly encourages [E.164 phone number formatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) for all phone numbers both in the ‘to’ and ‘from’ fields. This is an internationally-recognized standard phone number format that will help to ensure deliverability of calls and SMS messages across the globe.

Instead of reaching out from Salesmate using an [International Call Prefix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_call_prefixes#Countries_by_international_prefix) like 011, simply use an E.164 formatted phone number.

### **E.164 Phone Number Formatting**

E.164 formatting for phone numbers entails the following:

*   A + (plus) sign
*   International Country Calling code
*   Local Area code
*   Local Phone number

For example, here’s a US-based number in standard local formatting: **(415) 555-2671**

Here’s the same phone number in E.164 formatting: **+14155552671**

In the UK, and many other countries internationally, local dialing may require the addition of a '0' in front of the subscriber number. With E.164 formatting, this '0' must usually be removed.

For example, here’s a UK-based number in standard local formatting: 020 7183 8750

Here’s the same phone number in E.164 formatting: **+442071838750**
