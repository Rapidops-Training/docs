**Avoid using Wifi**

*   Use ethernet and not WiFi. The wireless medium can cause issues with the **call quality** and hence must be avoided. Use a LAN wired connection instead of wireless.

**Number of devices**

*   If you are using WiFi, ensure the number of devices operating on the same channel is as **minimal** as possible. Many devices sharing the same network cause a reduction in individual devices' efficiency.

**Voice data**

*   Avoid transferring huge amounts of voice data in the same WiFi network as it can add to the latency. 

**High bandwidth**

*   Using high bandwidth internet connection as lower bandwidth adds to the inherent latency involved in algorithmic processing, network traversal, etc.
*   Local network conditions have the highest impact on voice quality. Make sure you have sufficient bandwidth and try using ethernet for voice data.

**Check your router's configuration**

*   If you have addressed the above issues and continue to have a jitter-related impact on your voice quality, try configuring your router with [QoS rules](http://www.pcworld.com/article/212867/optimize_your_office_router_for_voip_video.html) to prioritize traffic on the UDP ports ranging from 10000-20000.

**Prefer wired headsets over Bluetooth ones**

*   We recommend USB / 3.5mm headsets over Bluetooth ones. If you’re using Bluetooth headsets, connect the USB dongle for better call strength. This is because each browser behaves differently with different hardware vendors and it becomes impossibly difficult to troubleshoot such issues. Reduce ambient noise such as nearby speakers, fans, exhaust, etc.

 **Browser preference:** 

*   Use a Chrome/Firefox browser also don’t run other processor-intensive applications in parallel to Salesmate Calling. Try disabling any antivirus software if installed.

 **Modem preference:** 

*   Go for a modern, well-equipped PC with sufficient RAM. Try to have moderate tab usage (too many tabs eat up your RAM)

**VPN:**

*   Facing a Problem with calling using VPN Services, You will probably find the problem is coming in due to a combination of the latency and additional bandwidth limitations between your VPN provider and your Salesmate calling. 
    
*   The lag will be discernible, and packet loss becomes more of an issue in most cases.
    
*   Might it not make more sense to not use a VPN for your VOIP calls, and rely on VOIP encryption with your Twilio as a service provider to get a better balance between quality and privacy
