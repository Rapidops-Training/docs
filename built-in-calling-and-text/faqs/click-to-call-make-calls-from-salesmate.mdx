Making VOIP calls from Salesmate just got easier!

Salesmate now gives you the ability to customize which app you would like to make calls from, making it possible to set up Skype calls or SMS, calls with Lync, calls via Google Voice and many SIP-based phone systems.

<Note>


**Note:** A user with an administrator profile can do this.

*   Click on \***Provider** to add a provider for example: "Apple"
*   Click on **\*Syntax** to add syntax for example: "tel:\[number\]"
*   Each click-to-call option will require the following fields
    *   **Provider label:** This will be shown at the time of initiating calls from the screen for example: "Apple"
    *   **Syntax:** This will be used by Salesmate to call protocols that will be listened to by the browser or installed apps.
*   You can set up multiple click-to-call options from the page
*   Hit **Save** to store all those options.

*   You can check with your SIP/phone vendor for details on how to use their services with browser-based links. However, here are some of the most common syntaxes that might be useful:
    *   **skype:\[number\]?call** — Skype call
    *   **skype:\[number\]?chat** — Skype SMS
    *   **sip:\[number\]@gateway.com** — SIP phone handler (check with your service provider for details)
    *   **facetime://\[number\]** — Apple FaceTime call
    *   **tel:\[number\]** — Default phone call handler
    *   **callto:\[number\]** — Default phone call handler that commonly triggers a Skype call
    *   **sms:\[number\]** — Default SMS handler
