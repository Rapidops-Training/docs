- *Handling network failure instances** If any of the tests fail, it might be indicative of certain firewall restrictions blocking Salesmate from communicating with the internet. Here, TCP, UDP, or both of these would have failed.

The best way to go forward is to **whitelist all the IP addresses** and **open the ports** that are mentioned by Twilio. To check the whitelisted IP addresses and ports please refer: [Whitelisted IP addresses](#basic-network-terminologies-bandwidthbandwidth-describes-the-maximum-data-transfer-rate-of-a-network-or-internet-connection-it-measures-how-much-data-can-be-sent-over-a-specific-connection-in-a-given-amount-of-time-please-increase-the-network-bandwidth-if-needed-this-is-a-crucial-step-that-would-solve-most-of-your-call-quality-issues)**ICE error** Next is the ICE error which is the most common issue that you might encounter. (In this scenario, your call will be disconnected within 10 seconds. A possible solution for this is to Whitelist the IPs and open up the respective ports.The next step is to check the **number of simultaneous Salesmate connections** that Salesmate can support within your network. For example, if a team of 20 users uses Salesmate calling at the same time and if the result shows that Salesmate supports only 12 simultaneous calls, there would be time lags, call quality issues, one-way audio issues, and a high possibility of call drops.Ensure that the network test is run on every agent’s local machine, and specifically make it mandatory for ones who report facing call quality issuesYou also need to check if the local machine is connected through **LAN or the wireless channel**(LAN is always the preferred option).Also, please do check if there are other applications(of lesser priority like Youtube, Chrome, etc.) consuming the available bandwidth. If that’s the case, please ask your network/IT team to **deprioritize the other applications and give maximum priority to call and call-related activities** to have a smooth call experience.

###  Basic Network Terminologies **Bandwidth:**Bandwidth describes the maximum data transfer rate of a network or internet connection. It measures how much data can be sent over a specific connection in a given amount of time. Please **increase** the **network bandwidth** if needed. This is a crucial step that would solve most of your call quality issues.

- **Latency:**The time taken by data packets to arrive at the destination. High latency can substantially degrade a caller's experience. Here are some strategies to minimize latency on your network:

Some lower bandwidth fixed internet connections can often have a higher latency. If possible, upgrade your internet connectivity.Stick to high-bandwidth connections. Mobile networks such as LTE (mobile 4G Data) can often have high latency.

- **Jitter**: Packet loss, most frequently jitter-induced packet loss, can make a big impact on your VoIP call quality. Wi-Fi can be particularly bad for creating jitters. Here are some strategies to minimize jitter on your network:
Use fixed ethernet instead of Wi-Fi whenever possibleReduce packet conflicts on Wi-Fi by reducing the number of devices operating on the same channel.Avoid large data file transfers over the same Wi-Fi environment concurrently with voice.
