title: 'Why is my number shown as "SPAM LIKELY" or "SPAM RISK" or "SCAM LIKELY"?'
---
Your contacts might see calls from your number(s) displayed as “SPAM LIKELY” or "SPAM RISK" or "SCAM LIKELY" on their Caller ID. Each phone carrier keeps a list of numbers they determine to be spam risks based on the history of the number. Unfortunately, there is no central database or service so far that manages this number designation.

###  What causes the SCAM/SPAM designation?

Here are the most obvious reasons for designation:The volume of Outbound Calls Per Day Per Number

Someone Flagged a call from your number in that carrier's app as spam Outbound Caller ID number is not set properly from your system and incomplete will probably be flagged as spam automatically.

###  Some background:

In response to the growing number of scam calls to mobile phones, many carriers and third parties have created tools to identify and block scam calls. Unfortunately, these tools aren’t perfect. Businesses may have their numbers incorrectly marked by scam ID technology, particularly when calling cell numbers.Each carrier has a feature or app, which is automatically enabled on mobile devices. When someone calls one of these devices, the carrier checks the number against its database of reported scam numbers. If the source matches a reported scam number, the person being called sees a message that says “Scam Likely” alongside standard caller ID. The user can then decide whether or not to answer the call.In addition to Scam ID, Carriers also allow customers to opt into a Scam Block feature that prevents all Scam Likely calls from reaching the user’s phone. All carriers now have introduced their own paid and free versions of this service. Third-party apps also allow smartphone users to detect, report and block scam calls.The Scam Likely Caller ID features will sometimes mark legitimate calls incorrectly. Some people may report your number without answering the phone. If this happens enough, your number will be marked Scam Likely.Carriers are also deploying algorithms in their networks to detect a large number of phone calls originating from a common Caller ID number. They designate these calls as SPAM and display a “SPAM” message on the display of the receiving phone.

###  Solution:

The quickest solution is to acquire a new inbound number and use it in place of the number that is getting the SPAM/SCAM reports. But note, when you acquire a number it may come with a history that also causes it to experience the same issue, so always test some calls to verify the number is being treated well by the Carriers.
