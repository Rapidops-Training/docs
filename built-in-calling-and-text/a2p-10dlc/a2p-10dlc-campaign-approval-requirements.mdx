T **o help ensure your Campaigns are approved in this vetting process, please follow these best practices when submitting new Campaigns.** | Campaign Field | Description | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

[prohibited content](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/22668967053209-Forbidden-Message-Categories-in-the-US-and-Canada-Short-Code-Toll-Free-and-Long-Code)
such as cannabis, hate speech, etc., and that your use case is compliant with the
[Salesmate Messaging Policy.](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/360044649672-Salesmate-Messaging-Policy)

###  Ensure data accuracy and consistency.

Make sure you submit Campaign registrations with accurate and consistent data:

| Best Practice | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Consistency in brand, website, and sample messages | If your brand name is Acme, your website is www.acme.com, but your sample messages say, “Here’s your one-time passcode for logging into www.contoso.com,” your campaign will be rejected. |
| Consistency in sample messages and use cases | If you register a marketing campaign but sample messages say, “Here’s your one-time passcode: 123456”, your campaign will be rejected. |
| Consistency in email domain and company name | Your campaign will be rejected if you register a brand as LeadConnector Inc but provide an email address with the gmail domain names. *Note that this check only applies to large, well-known corporations that should have dedicated email domains |
| Make sure you submit real, working websites. | Indicating that your customers opt-in to your messages via the website, but providing a website address that does not work, will lead to campaign rejection. |
| Make sure the brand you register is the actual brand that you’re sending messages for | If ISV customers register a brand with your company’s information (e.g., a company that provides the tech for dental offices) but end up sending messages for your customers (e.g., individual dentist practices), your campaign will be rejected. |
| Make sure you create as few duplicative brands and campaigns as possible | Excessive brands with the same EIN and excessive campaigns with the same campaign attributes may be seen as high-risk and may result in campaign rejection |
| If you wish to send templated messages, please indicate the templated fields in sample messages with brackets to help reviewers better identify which parts are templated. | For example, please write, “Dental check due for [Mary Doe], Visit [www.contoso.com] to schedule an appointment or call [123-456-7890]” |

###  Ensure your use case involves consumer consent before sending messages

Make sure you collect consumer consent appropriately. Please refer to the [CTIA guidelines](https://api.ctia.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/230523-CTIA-Messaging-Principles-and-Best-Practices-FINAL.pdf) for detailed instructions and best practices on handling consumer consent.

| Best Practice | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Make sure consumer opt-in is collected appropriately | If you indicate you collect opt-in via text messages, but your sample messages say, “Hi, is this the owner of 123 Oak Street? I’d like to discuss how I can help you sell your property”, it is clear that you have not collected appropriate consent before sending messages and your campaign will be rejected. |
| Make sure opt-in language is available on your website if you indicated in the “message flow” field that a consumer opts into your campaign on your company website. | If your brand Acme uses its website, www.acme.com, to collect phone numbers but your website does not contain opt-in language such as “By providing your phone number, you agree to receive text messages from ACME. Message and data rates may apply. Message frequency varies.”, your campaign will be rejected. |
| We recommend having opt-out language in at least one of your sample messages. | For example, please add language such as “Please reply STOP to opt-out” in one of your sample messages. | **Note:** The ecosystem constantly improves the vetting criteria as it comes across additional violations. Please do not consider the best practices listed above as a “catch-all” and guarantee approval as long as you follow them all; instead, consider them as a baseline that illustrates the general direction of compliant, high-quality messaging that the ecosystem is moving towards. |

###  Opt-In

Campaigns require a proper opt-in method which ensures that end-users provide consent to receive text messages. Verbal opt-in is the most difficult method to verify however, is acceptable as long enough details are provided that a 3rd party reviewer can verify.

| Opt-In Method | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Verbal | Salesmate IVR: "As part of our service we can send you automated monthly text alerts regarding Salesmate account payment activity. We will send two messages per month. Message and data rates may apply, depending on your mobile phone service plan. At any time you can get more help by replying HELP to these texts, or you can opt-out completely by replying STOP. Mobile Terms of Service are available at http://twil.io/terms and our Privacy Statement can be found at https://twil.io/privacy. Please reply with 'yes' or 'no' to indicate if you would like this service". Salesmate Customer: "Yes please" Salesmate IVR: "Great! We will send you a text message to confirm your enrollment here shortly." |
| Web Form | An embedded form on the end business’s website prompts end-users to enter their mobile handset phone number and opt into the texting campaign. Note checkbox should be selectable by the end-user for opting in. If the web opt-in is behind a login or not yet published, host a screenshot on a publicly accessible website (like OneDrive or Google Drive) and provide the URL in the Message Flow Field. |
| Paper Form | An in-store visitor completes a physical form that collects their phone number and their consent to subscribe to your texting campaign. Host a screenshot of the paper form on a publicly accessible website (like OneDrive or Google Drive) and provide the URL in the Message Flow Field. |
| Via Text | Host a screenshot of the campaign collateral on a publicly accessible website (like OneDrive or Google Drive) and provide the URL in the Message Flow Field. |
| Mobile QR Code | A QR code that links to an online form that prompts end-users to enter their mobile handset phone number and opt into the texting campaign. QR code can direct the mobile handset to their messaging application with a templated opt-in message or can lead to a web form as outlined above. If the QR code leads to an online form that is behind a login or not yet published, host a screenshot of the form on a publicly accessible website (like OneDrive or Google Drive) and provide the URL in the Message Flow Field. |
