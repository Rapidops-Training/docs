Once an [A2P 10DLC](https://support.salesmate.io/knowledge/articles/22579328369689/en-us?brand_id=1467849) Brand or Campaign has been submitted to and approved by the Campaign Registry (TCR), there is currently no way to make updates to that campaign. If you need to make changes to an existing campaign, you’ll need to submit a new Brand or Campaign.

### Can I edit an A2P Brand?

Yes. As of December 16, 2021, if your Brand registration attempt fails and Salesmate receives feedback from TCR about the failure reason, you can edit the Brand via the Salesmate and resubmit. Salesmate will cover the cost of retrying Brand registration for 2 additional attempts - a total value of $88.

<Note>


**NOTE:** The two additional attempts at no cost only apply to edits on the same Brand. Submitting a new Brand will result in a new charge.


</Note>

If there is an inaccuracy in an A2P Brand that you have already successfully registered, please contact the Salesmate support team be sure to include your Salesmate Account ID and exactly which details need to be corrected in your Brand registration.

### Can I delete an A2P Brand?
