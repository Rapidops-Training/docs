#### **What information is required for registration?**

*   You will need information about each business and brand to register businesses, brands, and use cases. The required info includes the business name, physical address, and business type (LLC, partnership, etc.).

#### **Once I have completed registration, how do I make sure my phone numbers use 10DLC?**

*   Once your Brand(s) and Campaign(s) are approved, you will need to link each of your A2P Campaign Use Cases to a Messaging Service, and add phone numbers to that Messaging Service. Any numbers that you add to that Messaging Service will be automatically associated with the Campaign that you linked to that Messaging Service.
*   This article contains steps you can follow in the Salesmate Console or using our APIs to make sure that your numbers are configured correctly: [How do I check that I have completed US A2P 10DLC registration?](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/4418081745179-How-do-I-check-that-I-have-completed-US-A2P-10DLC-registration-)
*   By default, newly-created Messaging Services are set to "Defer to sender webhooks," meaning the Messaging Service will not override any existing inbound message handling you have configured on your Salesmate numbers. If you are using an existing Messaging Service that you created weeks or months ago, make sure its inbound message handling settings are configured the way you want before adding any numbers. You can do this by browsing that Service in the Salesmate Console, or using the [Messaging Services API.](https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/api/service-resource)

#### **Do I need to change the way I send outbound messages?**

*   If you don’t currently use Messaging Services in your application to send outbound messages, that’s OK – you won’t need to make changes within your application. It is not required to modify your application to include the Messaging Service SID in your API requests. It is only necessary to add the phone numbers to a Messaging Service, in order to associate them with a Campaign.

#### **What pricing and fees are associated with the A2P 10DLC service?**

*   For an overview of registration costs and per-message carrier fees associated with A2P 10DLC, please see [What pricing and fees are associated with the A2P 10DLC service?](https://support.salesmate.io/knowledge/articles/22590649559065/en-us?brand_id=1467849)

#### **How long does it take to get registered?**

*   A2P 10DLC registration is a multiple-step process that includes [registering a Business Profile, a US A2P Brand, and a Campaign use case.](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/a2p-10dlc/onboarding)
*   Brand registration can typically be completed in a few minutes if you've already collected all of the required information. For example, if you are registering a US-based business, you should ensure you have your Employer Identification Number (EIN) ready when you begin registration. However, in the event that there is a discrepancy with the information you provide, a manual review may be required for Secondary Vetting which can take up to 7 days. To avoid this please see A2P 10DLC Brand Approval Best Practices.
*   Effective January 26, 2023, all new A2P Campaign registrations are subject to a manual vetting process. Registration currently takes at least 3 weeks due to higher than normal volume of requests. Campaign submissions initiated at this time will most likely not be available before the August 31 2023 A2P registration deadline. We are working internally and with our industry partners to improve the vetting times. Please account for these delays when registering and for more information visit our FAQ on A2P 10DLC Campaign Vetting FAQ.

#### **Is MMS messaging affected by A2P 10DLC?**

*   Yes, MMS messaging via long code is subject to carrier fees as part of A2P 10DLC. We also expect registered MMS traffic to ultimately benefit from reduced carrier filtering. However, long code MMS messaging remains subject to throughput limits, due to limited carrier capacity. For high-volume MMS use cases in the United States, a short code is still the best option.

#### **What message sending throughput (MPS) do I get?**

*   Message throughput (MPS) will be allocated per registered Campaign Use Case. For many customers, A2P 10DLC will offer much higher throughput than the traditional 1 MPS for long code messaging, without the requirement of using additional numbers to get higher throughput.
*   For details, see Message throughput (MPS) and Trust Scores for A2P 10DLC in the US.

#### **How do these rule changes affect short codes and Toll-Free numbers? Should I switch to 10DLC?**

*   These changes do not directly affect shortcodes and Toll-Free numbers, except for officially prohibiting shared short codes for all use cases except authentication codes. Details below.

#### **Shared shortcodes will be banned, date TBD**

*   Dedicated short codes are still a great way to send high-volume A2P messaging in the United States. However, the use of shared short code numbers will be banned with the transition to A2P 10DLC. The only exception to this policy is shared short codes used to send 2-factor auth (2FA) or OTP codes only.
*   “Shared short codes” refers to short code numbers that are shared among multiple brands, for example, Shoe Company A and Beverage Company B send messages via the same short code number. If you have purchased a short code number from Twilio and are using it for your own business and brand only, you are not affected by this change.
*   Under the new policy, a short code may be shared across multiple companies only for the purposes of sending authentication code messages, for example, "Your login code is 12345." Any other category of messaging is not allowed on a shared shortcode.
*   Customers who are sharing a short code among multiple clients or brands for any purpose other than sending 2-factor codes (also known as OTPs) should completely migrate away from shared short codes.
*   Previously, the end date for shared short codes was identified as June 1, 2021. As of early 2022, the end date for shared short codes is on hold until the successful implementation of A2P 10DLC. A specific date will be shared here when we have information to share.

#### **Toll-Free SMS – no changes**

*   US Toll-Free phone numbers are not affected by these changes. Toll-Free SMS is still a great way to send A2P SMS in the United States as well as Canada. See [Information and best practices for using Toll-Free SMS in the US and Canada](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038172934-Information-and-best-practices-for-using-Toll-Free-SMS-and-MMS-in-the-US-and-Canada) for more information.

#### **Is there an API for registering Business Profiles, US A2P Brands, and Campaign Use Cases?**

*   Yes, for ISV-type customers who are invited to onboard their clients, Twilio is providing APIs for registering yourselves and your clients. You can view the documentation here: [ISV A2P 10DLC Registration: API Step-by-Step walkthrough.](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/a2p-10dlc/onboarding-isv-api)
*   Regardless of how you plan to register, we encourage you to go ahead and collect all the required information. See [How do I register to use A2P 10DLC messaging?](https://support.salesmate.io/knowledge/articles/22496364707481/en-us?brand_id=1467849) for a list.

#### **Is Verizon making any changes to their existing A2P 10DLC service?**

*   Verizon launched their A2P 10DLC service in January 2019. At this time, Verizon has not announced any plans to adopt these new Brand and Campaign registration requirements. If this ever occurs, Twilio will notify our customers in advance.
*   For now, Verizon’s A2P 10DLC service continues operating without changes. See the [Verizon A2P 10DLC FAQ](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008372654-Verizon-Wireless-SMS-and-MMS-carrier-fees-in-the-United-States) for details.

#### **What about other mobile networks in the US?**

*   Please note that the T-Mobile network includes Sprint and MetroPCS, as those networks were acquired by T-Mobile previously. All information above related to T-Mobile also applies to these networks.
*   US Cellular (the 4th largest mobile carrier in the US) has not announced specific A2P 10DLC plans as of January 2022.
*   Read on for details about other types of mobile networks.

**Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs)**

*   Many smaller branded mobile providers in the US are actually Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs), who utilize one or more of the major mobile networks for their service. [A list of US MVNOs is available on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_mobile_virtual_network_operators). Any numbers on an MVNO who primarily utilizes AT&T's network will also be affected by these changes.
*   If you perform a [Twilio Lookup](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/trusted-activation/lookup) on a mobile number operated by an MVNO, it will display the name of the primary host network (for example, AT&T or Verizon).

**Other independent mobile networks**

*   Small independent mobile networks in the US are a small percentage of the mobile market and are not affected by upcoming A2P 10DLC changes. A [list of mobile networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_wireless_communication_service_providers#Facilities-based_service_providers) in the US that own and operate their own network infrastructure is available on Wikipedia for reference.

#### **Is messaging to Canada, Puerto Rico or any other countries also affected by these changes?**

*   No, Canada mobile carriers are not impacted at this time. Canadian mobile carriers may introduce registered A2P 10DLC solutions in the future, but at this time carriers have not announced any plans to do so.
*   Yes, Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories are impacted as well. U.S. bound traffic is considered any outbound traffic to US, PR, VI, Guam, and American Samoa. Many recipients in these countries have telephone services from US based carriers. Messages to those recipients are treated exactly the same as messages to US-based recipients of those networks.
*   For information about message sending in countries other than the US, we recommend checking out our country-specific [SMS Guidelines](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/guidelines/sms) pages to learn about any unique rules or restrictions in that country.

#### **Is WhatsApp messaging affected by A2P 10DLC?**

*   No. WhatsApp messaging is unaffected by any of these changes. WhatsApp messages are transmitted over the Internet, rather than through carrier networks like SMS and MMS.
