### My Campaign Use Case was rejected - What can I do?

If your Campaign registration request was rejected and is ineligible, you may be able to use another Salesmate product to reach your recipients.The Salesmate Sendgrid Email API is an option for many of the above use cases. For example, cannabis- or CBD-related messaging may be conducted via email, as long as you have proper age gating in place and are sending toward recipients in a locale where the substance is legal. In addition, the Salesmate Programmable Voice product is not subject to the same carrier restrictions as SMS.

For more information about cannabis-related messaging alternatives, see the [Salesmate Message Policy](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/360044649672-Salesmate-Messaging-Policy).
