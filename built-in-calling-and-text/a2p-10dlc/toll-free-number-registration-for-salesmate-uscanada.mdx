**Twilio Will Block Messages from Restricted Toll-free Numbers: Effective November 8, 2023**The Toll-Free Messaging Verification process allows Salesmate customers to send more important business messages, and make sure your customers see them. Our users who adhere to their stated use case and all applicable rules (including Salesmate's Messaging policy) should see greatly reduced message filtering on Toll-Free traffic towards all major networks in the US and Canada. To help aid customers in the Toll-Free registration process, we have created this comprehensive overview.

### Who needs to verify?

Toll-free verification is currently required in the US and Canada for best delivery. Users who don't verify risk being blocked (Canada), or increasing filtering and daily limits on sending traffic (US). For more information, see What happens if I don't complete Verification.**Note:**As of April 1, 2023, a daily limit of 500 message segments / 1,000 weekly / 2,000 monthly are applied to traffic sent over restricted (previously “Unverified”) Toll-Free phone numbers in the US.Submitting your completed verification form to the carrier places the Toll-Free number(s) in a Pending Verification status, which allows for higher volume limits (2,000 daily / 6,000 weekly / 10,000 monthly) and reduces the chances of filtering while waiting for final carrier approval.Any traffic - restricted or pending - that exceeds the daily limit or is filtered for spam will see an [Error 30032](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/errors/30032) response returned for both scenarios. To avoid this, we recommend submitting your number(s) for verification as soon as possible to get full approval.Please note, that these Toll-Free caps are maximum limits, (not a guaranteed daily minimum), so traffic could still experience message filtering even when well below the daily limits if not verified.

### Verification processing

Upon receipt of your submission, Salesmate submits your application to Twilio who reviews and processes your verification request. Please allow approximately 2-3 weeks for this process.At this point, Twilio will automatically move the numbers associated with your request into the**Pending Verification status**, which opens up sending with less filtering applied to your traffic while the verification is processed. Beginning**April 1, 2023**, Pending Verification numbers have the following limits:

Daily limit: 2,000 message segmentsWeekly limit: 6,000 message segmentsMonthly limit: 10,000 message segments**Note:**These limits are the tentative daily maximums, and are not guaranteed. Traffic to Canada will continue to be fully blocked while in Restricted status.

###**Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**####**What happens if I don't complete Verification?**On**October 1, 2022**, restricted (previously “unverified”) traffic was fully blocked in Canada, and increased filtering with lower daily limits were applied in the US. Beginning**April 1, 2023**, the thresholds for Toll-Free numbers in both Restricted and Pending states will have new limits applied (see below) and traffic to Canada will continue to be fully blocked in the Restricted status.All restricted traffic filtered for these reasons will be blocked with [error code 30032](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/errors/30032). Using additional Toll-Free numbers to exceed these limits or circumvent filtering isn’t allowed, and will result in the same block and error code. Verification is recommended for all customers regardless of volume.

####**What can I do if my Verification request is rejected?**If your Toll-Free verification request is rejected, you may be able to re-submit a corrected request. Rejections for [content](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045004974-Forbidden-Message-Categories-for-SMS-and-MMS-in-the-US-and-Canada), or [Acceptable Use Policy](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/22747336265369/preview/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6MjI3NDczMzYyNjUzNjksInJldmlzaW9uX2lkIjoiMDFIOVNXSllYSDVFN1RDVks0VDdCUlFFTVMiLCJleHAiOjE2OTQxNjMyOTl9.5ONE5IQs-Jph6f4w_lnZjoMUB8tF1rjbXAj-ImIKtE8) / [Messaging Policy](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/360044649672-Salesmate-Messaging-Policy) violations are ineligible, and can't be re-submitted.

####**What are the Industry-wide thresholds for sending traffic over restricted (previously “unverified”) Toll-Free numbers?**As of**October 1, 2022**, Twilio applied the following industry-wide thresholds for messaging sent over Restricted Toll-Free numbers:

Daily limit: 2,000 message segmentsWeekly limit: 12,000 message segmentsMonthly limit: 25,000 message segments

Beginning**April 1, 2023**, these thresholds are being lowered in the US:

Daily limit: 500 message segmentsWeekly limit: 1,000 message segmentsMonthly limit: 2,000 message segments

These thresholds are subject to change; we’ll let you know at least 30 days in advance before we make threshold changes.Beginning**April 1, 2023**, Pending Verification numbers have the following limits in the US:

Daily limit: 2,000 message segmentsWeekly limit: 6,000 message segmentsMonthly limit: 10,000 message segments

These limits aren’t applicable when a Toll-Free number has completed verification.**Notice**: These limits are the daily maximums, and are not guaranteed. If you start to see [30032 errors](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/errors/30032) but have not reached the posted limitations, you can assume that the messages are being filtered, and should submit that Toll-Free number for verification as soon as possible.Please complete the Verification process as soon as possible to avoid these daily limits. For more information, see [What happens if I don't complete Verification.](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/22751204870425-Toll-Free-Number-Registration-for-Salesmate-US-Canada#h_01GTCP1ZVAMDMY4Y7YB75YF7WR)**Toll-Free Verification Form:**[Salesmate Form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=g8pgUk95NkKUCTLkTG1ngRgCQ75ab_NPm3ty1GpuaKRUMTYyTVZSNDZWWDVKWTFNSUswTFM2RkJWQy4u)

####**How can I get higher-throughput Toll-Free Messaging?**If you need higher throughput than the standard 3 messages per second (MPS) on a Toll-Free number, Twilio offers High-Throughput Toll-Free messaging. Traffic verification is included as part of the High-Throughput setup process.

For further information, see [Toll-Free SMS and MMS messaging throughput (MPS)](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411046744987-Toll-Free-SMS-and-MMS-messaging-throughput-MPS-).If you are interested in High-Throughput Toll-Free messaging, please [talk to our Sales team.](https://www.salesmate.io/contact/)

####**Do I need to go through the verification process again for toll-free numbers that I'm porting to Salesmate?**Yes, currently there is no way to transfer toll-free verifications between providers. In order to minimize any downtime, we highly recommend submitting your verification request as soon as the porting process is completed for your number.
