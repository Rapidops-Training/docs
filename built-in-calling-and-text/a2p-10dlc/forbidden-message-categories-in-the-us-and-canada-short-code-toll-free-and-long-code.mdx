### Forbidden Use Cases

*   Certain types of messages are not allowed, and we take these restrictions seriously to maintain a safe and reliable messaging environment for all users. It is essential to refrain from engaging in the following activities listed in the table below. Please note that these forbidden use cases are not only related to the content of the message but the business type itself.
*   Additional Restrictions
*   *   Even if your specific use case is not listed as prohibited, certain message content may still be subject to restrictions. For instance, the use of shared or free public URL shorteners is not permitted and will lead to filtering. Ensure that when using a shortened URL it is company-branded.

### Forbidden message categories for SMS/MMS in the US/Canada

Category

Examples

Notes

High-risk financial services

*   Payday loans
*   Short term high-interest loans
*   New loan soliciting
*   Third-party loans
*   Student loans
*   Cryptocurrency
*   Stocks and investing platforms

"Third-party" means originating from any party other than the one which will service the loan.

Examples of third-party loans could include: auto, mortgage, personal, etc.

First party loan content is acceptable if it is not promotional messaging.

No businesses that solely operate in stocks, investing, or cryptocurrency are allowed to send SMS traffic. If there is a mixed use case where that is a partial aspect of the business it may be approved based on the other use case content.

Third-party lead generation services and marketing

*   Companies, NGOs or political campaigns that buy, sell, or share consumer information.
*   Affiliate lending
*   Affiliate marketing
*   Deceptive marketing

Any third-party use cases are strictly forbidden. Consent must be obtained directly from end-users.

Political use case customers sending SMS messages are not able to use voter registration databases to collect consent and outreach end-users.

Any business with a terms of service or privacy policy that mentions sharing or selling consumer data/opt-in information is considered non-compliant.

Debt collection or forgiveness

*   Third-party debt collection
*   Debt consolidation
*   Debt reduction
*   Debt relief
*   Credit/debt repair

"Third-party" means originating from any party other than the one who is owed the debt. For example, a hospital could send messages regarding bills for its own patients, assuming they provided opt-in to receive that messaging.

While third party debt collection is not permitted, a debt collection business that has direct consent from end-users to send related content may do so.

Debt consolidation, debt reduction and credit repair programs are prohibited regardless if there is first-party consent.

  

“Get rich quick” schemes

*   Deceptive work-from-home programs
*   Risk investment opportunities
*   Pyramid schemes
*   Mystery Shopping
*   Multi Level Marketing (MLM)

This is different from outreach about employment as a result of compliant opt-in practices, messages from brokerages to their members, investment news alerts, or other investment-related messages.

Illegal substances/articles

*   Cannabis
*   CBD
*   Kratom
*   Paraphernalia products
*   Vape/E-cigs
*   Fireworks

Cannabis, CBD, Kratom, or drug paraphernalia product businesses are prohibited from utilizing SMS/MMS messaging on Twilio in the US and Canada, regardless of content. These restrictions apply regardless of the federal or state legality. All use cases for these are disallowed from sending SMS whether it contains cannabis content or not, even for 2FA purposes it is not permissible for such entities.

Prescription drugs

*   Drugs that require a prescription

Offers for drugs that cannot be sold over-the-counter in the US/Canada are forbidden regardless if the business is a licensed professional.

Gambling

*   Casino apps
*   Websites that offer gambling
*   Sweepstakes
*   50/50 Raffles  
    Contests
*   Betting/Sports picks

Gambling traffic is prohibited in the US and Canada on all number types (Toll Free, Short Code, Long Code).

Sweepstakes are allowed on Short Code but need to go through a special review.

Bingo related messages are allowed on an approved Short Code.

  

"S.H.A.F.T." use cases and electronic smoking devices

*   Sex
*   Hate
*   Alcohol
*   Firearms
*   Tobacco
*   Vape/E-ciggs

Alcohol traffic is allowed on Toll Free, Short Code, and Long Code in the US, as long as proper age gating procedures are in place. Age gating means that website users must input their date of birth. It cannot be a yes or no question.

Firearms, Tobacco, Vape, and E-cigarettes are not allowed on Toll Free, Short Code, or Long Code regardless of age gating.

All age-gated content into Canada must be blocked across Toll Free, Short Code, and Long Code. The only way to send age-gated traffic into Canada (even with proper age-gating) is to receive a special carrier exemption. Allowed age gated content in Canada include: pocket knives, lighters, and non-alcoholic beverages

<Note>


**Notice:** Any use cases that violate Twilio's [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/aup) or [Salesmate Messaging Policy](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/360044649672-Salesmate-Messaging-Policy) are also not allowed on Twilio's platform, regardless of number/sender type or destination country.

### My use case is listed as forbidden. What can I do?

*   If your use case is listed above as forbidden for SMS and MMS messaging in the US, you may be able to use another Twilio product to reach your recipients.
*   The Salesmate Sendgrid Email API (Send all your marketing and transactional email through our platform with a proprietary mail transfer agent and infrastructure for scalable delivery.) is an option for many of the above use cases. For example, cannabis- or CBD-related messaging may be conducted via email, as long as you have proper age gating (requiring a date of birth from website users) in place and are sending toward recipients in a locale where the substance is legal. In addition, the [Salesmate Programmable Voice](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/360004664432-Introduction-to-Salesmate-Calling) product is not subject to the same carrier restrictions as SMS.
*   For more information about cannabis-related messaging alternatives, see [Can I send cannabis or CBD-related messaging traffic on Twilio?](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/1260804628349-Can-I-send-cannabis-or-CBD-related-messaging-traffic-on-Twilio-)
