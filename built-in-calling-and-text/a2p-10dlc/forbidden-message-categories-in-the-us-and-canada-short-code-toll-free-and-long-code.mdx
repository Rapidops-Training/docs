###  Forbidden Use Cases

Certain types of messages are not allowed, and we take these restrictions seriously to maintain a safe and reliable messaging environment for all users. It is essential to refrain from engaging in the following activities listed in the table below. Please note that these forbidden use cases are not only related to the content of the message but the business type itself.Additional Restrictions
Even if your specific use case is not listed as prohibited, certain message content may still be subject to restrictions. For instance, the use of shared or free public URL shorteners is not permitted and will lead to filtering. Ensure that when using a shortened URL it is company-branded.
