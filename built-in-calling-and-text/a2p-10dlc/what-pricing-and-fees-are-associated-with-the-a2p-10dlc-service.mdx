Both types of fees are charged by carriers as part of the A2P 10DLC system and are passed through by Twilio to our customers with no added cost.Registration fees are applied when registering your US A2P Brand and your A2P Use Case, the moment they are registered with TCR.Carrier fees are charged by carriers for A2P 10DLC messages sent to users on their networks. These fees are applied in addition to Twilio’s standard US Messaging pricing. In general, the fees are applied for each outbound SMS segment or MMS message.
