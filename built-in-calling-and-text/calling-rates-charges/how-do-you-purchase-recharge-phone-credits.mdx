Once you have enabled your phone app you will need credits to purchase your phone number and credits to start calling from Salesmate. In case you exhaust your phone credits by purchasing numbers or making calls, an error message is shown.

If so, you need to recharge(add credits) before trying to purchase more numbers or make calls.
