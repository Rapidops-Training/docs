Unlimited calling plans are a popular service offered by many VoIP providers. With unlimited subscription, you can provide your agents with plenty of talk time at a great value without having to worry about unpredictable monthly usage bills.

Unfortunately, these types of VoIP calling plans leave providers vulnerable to having their services abused by fraudsters. To protect themselves, VoIP providers that offer unlimited subscriptions include a “fair use” or “acceptable use” policy with their services, which places a cap on the maximum amount of call time each account can use. As a potential customer, it is important to understand that not all fair use policies are created equal.

Thus, Salesmate does not provide unlimited calling to give you the flexibility a no-contract calling plan and pay for only the duration you have made the call.
