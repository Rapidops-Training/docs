title: "How do you create an activity after or during a call?"
---
Customers might call you for a number of reasons. They might want a trial period extension, new features, or simply have their calls returned. To help you engage, prioritize, and manage calls better, Salesmate lets you take notes during the call and create activities soon after your call has ended.
