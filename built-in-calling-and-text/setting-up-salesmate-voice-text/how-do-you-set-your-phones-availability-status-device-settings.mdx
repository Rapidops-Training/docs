<Note>


**Note**:

*   If you have the option (Forward calls to mobile phone) checked. Salesmate by default forwards calls to your mobile number under your My Account details. If you don’t have a mobile number or if that number is incorrect, Salesmate does not log the calls.
*   The number mentioned on your My Account should be in the proper dialing format and should be prefixed by your own country code. **Example :  +1-541-754-3010**  
    
    Always, mention it in the [E.164 format](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/360012360991-Formatting-International-Phone-Numbers)
    
*   If you have set your availability to unavailable and the number is only assigned to you, calls will be logged as a **Missed Call Activity** and you will receive email alerts for the same otherwise it will ring out to the next available person on that number.


</Note>

### Choose how you’d like to answer your calls

*   From the phone widget, click the **Phone Icon** followed by **Settings**.
*   If you choose **Answer calls in the browser -**  You can attend all incoming calls directly inside Salesmate when it's open in your web browser. In case you are logged out you will be considered unavailable on the browser. 
*   If you choose **Forward calls to the mobile phone -**  Salesmate will redirect the incoming calls directly on your linked phone when you are not using Salesmate web app or on the move. You must provide your **Mobile** number under your **My Account > General.**
*   If you select **Answer calls on Mobile App** - You will receive all the calls in your Salesmate Mobile App.
*   If **options number 1 and 3 are turned ON together-**  You can attend to all incoming calls either in your browser OR your phone at the same call rate.
*   If **all three options** are chosen then it will always forward calls to your mobile phone mentioned under My Account. 

<Note>


**Note:** You will be charged a different call rate to receive calls on the **Mobile Phone** which is usually higher than the one for attending calls in your **Browser**.

### How to change the Device Settings

*   **Microphone**: By default, it will display the in-built microphone of the system and if no drivers are detected then it will show “_No microphone found_”
*   **Speaker/Headset:** By default, it will display the in-built speaker of the system and if no drivers are detected then it will show “_No speaker/headset found_”
*   **Test**: This option will play the sound in the selected speaker/headset.
