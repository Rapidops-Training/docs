Call recordings are a great way to analyze conversations. Listening to call recordings offers a fresh perspective and reveals details that might have been overlooked when you or your sales reps were on the call. Use these calls for training purposes for future calls.In Salesmate you’d be able to associate call recordings to the concerned contacts and also add new contacts for the same.
