In Salesmate, with the inbuilt phone, all phone calls you make, receive, and miss is automatically logged. Call logs come in handy when you need to add new leads or contacts after having conversed with them over the phone. It doesn’t always have to be new leads or contacts, existing contacts and leads might call you from a number that isn’t registered in your account. In such cases, you can attach the call log to the relevant records and follow up with them.
