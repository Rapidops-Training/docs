In Salesmate, all phone calls you make and receive are automatically logged.

You can check them by:

*   Navigate to **Add Widget** on **Dashboard**

*   Search for **Call Logs.**
*   Click on **Add to Dashboard.**

However, on the off chance that you receive a call from a contact on your personal number. You might want to have it logged too, for that Salesmate allows you to manually log calls and also add notes for the same.
