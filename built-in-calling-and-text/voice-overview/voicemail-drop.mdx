title: "Voicemail Drop"
---
Sales reps spend a lot of time doing cold calling and the majority of calls end in **voicemail**. Repeating the same message, again and again, can be hectic and by the end of the day, it loses energy to drop a compelling message to pursue a sale. With the Salesmate **voicemail drop** feature, you can store multiple pre-recorded messages and choose one to be auto-dropped when the call ends to a voicemail.

- **Note:**The Feature is available on Business Plan and above only. The VM Drops can be uploaded/added by an Admin user only.
