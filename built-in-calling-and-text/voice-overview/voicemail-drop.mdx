Sales reps spend a lot of time doing cold calling and the majority of calls end in**voicemail**. Repeating the same message, again and again, can be hectic and by the end of the day, it loses energy to drop a compelling message to pursue a sale. With the Salesmate**voicemail drop**feature, you can store multiple pre-recorded messages and choose one to be auto-dropped when the call ends to a voicemail.**Note:**The Feature is available on Business Plan and above only. The VM Drops can be uploaded/added by an Admin user only.
