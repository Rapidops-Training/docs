An internet speed test is a quick and easy way to assess the performance of your internet service. If your internet appears to be slower than it should be, running a speed test is the quickest way to determine whether the problem is on your end or with your internet service provider.

Speed test uses your device's internet connection to determine the speed between your device and a test server. Several factors can have an effect on the speed recorded by a test: Wi-Fi and cellular radio capabilities vary greatly between devices (phones, tablets, PCs, etc.).

Check the network speed with [speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/) and send a screenshot of the findings to **support@salesmate.io** or over **chat**.
