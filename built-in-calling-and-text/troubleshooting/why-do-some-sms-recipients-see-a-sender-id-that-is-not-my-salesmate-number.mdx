A sender ID is**an alphabetic name that identifies the sender of an SMS message**.Â Sender ID change may occur when you send messages from a number that is not local to your recipients, for example- when using a US number to send SMS to German mobile users, your sender ID appears on the recipient's device instead of a phone number. This is often done to comply with local regulations or to ensure the highest possible delivery rate for your messages.

**Note:**Sender ID change will**not**occur when you send messages using a number from the same country as the recipient, for example- using a US number to send SMS to a US mobile user.Sender ID change does not negatively affect delivery quality, however, it means that replies from recipients will not be routed back to your number.
