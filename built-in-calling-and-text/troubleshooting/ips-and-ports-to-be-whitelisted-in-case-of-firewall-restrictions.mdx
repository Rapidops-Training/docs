title: "IP’s and Port’s to be Whitelisted in case of Firewall restrictions"
---
- **IP whitelisting**(allowlisting) entails creating a list of trusted IP addresses (dedicated static IP addresses are required), assigning them to a user or group of users as a unique identifier, and allowing the IP address to be used only on the target server.

###  Typically, IP whitelisting is handled on:**Edge routers**- typically set up to block undesired traffic on router's TCP and UDP port in order to protect internal LAN from the public internet threats **Firewall**- configured to grant access to the network only to specific users/devices/LANs ** Business VPN gateway **Web serve** r - typically to manage incoming requests and prevent extensive malicious requests (brute force attacks)**Application layer**- incoming queries can be evaluated and blocked/allowed by design in the code of the application ** SaaS application **- SaaS apps usually allow setting up IP whitelists to harden security measures.

The firewall should allow outgoing UDP to the public internet from the browsers that use **Salesmate Calling**, and allow return traffic in response.

| Component | Address | Server-side port used | Protocol |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Signaling - GLL (Global Low Latency) | chunderw-gll.twilio.com chunderw-vpc-gll.twilio.com | 443 | TCP |
| Signaling - Regional | chunderw-vpc-gll-{region}.twilio.com (Regions: au1, br1, de1, ie1, jp1, sg1, us1) | 443 | TCP |
| RTP | Static IP range * | 10,000 - 20,000 | UDP |
| Insights | eventgw.twilio.com | 443 | TCP |

For the **static IP range for UDP**, please open up the traffic to the following **CIDRs**. You have to open up traffic to all the CIDRs mentioned below. Twilio will dynamically connect to one of these IP ranges depending on the browser location.
