### How to configure incoming emails (BCC) in Salesmate?

You get your own email address, which you can add to the BCC field whenever you email a customer, or you can forward existing emails directly to this address. These conversations will all appear in your Salesmate email page, linked to the relevant contacts and deals, when possible. Set the forwarding rule to forward emails to your Salesmate Mailbox address by following the below steps:**To receive emails:\*** Go to Dashboard

- Click on the Email icon

- Go to**Email settings\*** Click on the**SMTP & BCC**tab

- Copy the Inbox email address (BCC)  -Example: "`<un-2ab15c4cccec8b894804c7be76cb9cc9@demo.salesmate.io>`"

- You can also enable**strict email forwarding**. This means you will receive emails from only the account that you have configured. You can add other addresses from which you want to receive emails by adding them to the secondary email address list.
