### Do you have these questions?


*   Having trouble lately connecting your Gmail Alias accounts?

*   Why your Gmail alias account is not working anymore?

We have answers to all your queries, recently**Gmail**has updated its policies and has stopped support for all personal free Gmail accounts. This would mean that you need to have a**Corporate**/**Enterprise**Gmail account to access this feature.


*   What if you have an enterprise Gmail account and are still not able to connect your alias account with Salesmate, don't worry there is now a secured way to do it. Gmail has brought in a new way of doing so with the help of - [**Sign In using App Passwords**](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en)

*   An**App**password is a**16-digit passcode**that gives an app or device**permission**to access your**Google Account.***   If you use 2-Step Verification and are seeing a “**password incorrect”**or "**Cannot connect to SMTP Server**" error when trying to access your Google Account, an App password may solve the problem.

*   Most of the time, you’ll only have to enter an App password once per app or device, so don’t worry about memorizing it.
