Salesmate supports [Liquid JS](https://liquidjs.com/) which uses a combination of [objects](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/#objects), [tags](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/#tags), and [filters](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/#filters) inside email templates to display dynamic content and can also be used in workflows, and automation journeys to calculate field values based on different fields.

You can insert attributes along with functions to dynamically replace values by clicking on {} in the template.  Select the field that you want to replace.

Add "|" in the attribute to apply the function.

**How to auto-replace the last name when the last name is not mentioned in any contact?**

**SM:** To auto-replace the last name with a default word when the last name does not exist in contact, you can use the "default" function in an email template. It allows you to specify a fallback in case a value does not exist.  In this example, the Last Name is not defined, so the default value is used.

**Input:** `{{ Contact.lastName | default: "there"}}`

**Output:**

**How to update the date format in the attribute?**

**SM:** To update the date format in the attribute, you can use the "Date" function.  In this example, the value of the custom field is updated in YYYY-MM-DD format.

**Input:** Your Due Date is: `{{Contact.dateCustomField1 | date: "%Y-%m-%d"}}`

**Output:** Your Due Date is: 2020-12-23

**How can I multiply the value by the existing field in Salesmate?**

**SM:** To multiply a specific number with a field value you can use the "times" function.  In this example, we are multiplying the field "Commission" with integer 5.

**Input:** Your Commission is $`{{Contact.dateCustomField1 | times: 5}}`

**Output:** Your Commission is $1000
