The Daily Digest is an email that Salesmate sends you once a day. The email tells you about any activities that need your attention. It is an easy way to have an uncluttered Inbox instead of receiving notifications now and then for each activity assigned to you. You can choose your daily digest email delivery time too.

- **To set up the daily digest email:** Navigate to the **profile icon** top right cornerClick on **My Account** Select** Notification Preferences ***![Screenshot 2024-02-21 at 5.35.21 PM.png](./images/Screenshot-2024-02-21-at-5.35.21-PM.png)
