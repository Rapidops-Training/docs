However, you can send bulk email more than 250 in batches of 250 in go by filtering data in listing page or scrolling to another page.In Salesmate maximum 250 records are shown on one page hence a batch of 250 emails can be created at a time.It is recommended to shoot maximum 250 emails per day to your leads to avoid spamming and slowing of the process.However Salesmate does not restrict the number of emails per day, but your email provider might have restrictions on your per day email, considering the service and packs you have been offered.**Reference Links :**
