| Type | Host | Points to | TTL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CNAME | et | t.salesmatemail.com | 1 Hour |
| CNAME | ot | t.salesmatemail.com | 1 Hour |
| Note: - Some domains need you to specify the complete Host thus enter:et.abc.com and ot.abc.com respectively - Repeat the same steps for "ot" CNAME as well - Set the TTL to the minimum time available |

Once you have added CNAME records, you might have to wait for 30 minutes to 72 hours based on your domain service provider to update those CNAME recordsOnce CNAME records are updated, you can come back to the page and hit the verify button

Once the domain gets verified, the outgoing emails will start sending tracking links with your domain name **Note**:

You can set and verify multiple domainsYou can also choose a default domain in case of sending the SMTP domain is not verifiedAt the time of sending emails, the system will check the domain name of the outgoing email. If it matches the domain you have verified, then tracking links will be overwritten with the provided domain namePlease note end-user must have SSL certificates installed for provided sub-domains to avoid any security warningWe always use SSL-based images to track the open trackingIf the user has added a URL inside the email with HTTPS, then the tracking URL will also be generated with SSL. If the user has provided a non-SSL URL, then the tracking URL might follow non-SSL URLs
