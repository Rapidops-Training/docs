Lead providers provide us with emails with a predefined structure that includes information on the lead or prospect. It takes a lot of time to copy and paste all the details manually. We can quickly and effectively automate these procedures using lead parsing.You can use the lead parsing function to convert emails you receive from your lead providers into contacts and conduct your business flow automatically.**Note**: This feature is only available in Pro (Legacy Plan: Growth) and above plans.

On this page, you need to do an additional setup under which you can manage the options mentioned below:**Alias**- Add an alias for your source provider to identify it quickly when there are other similar providers.
By default, the alias value will auto-populate with the value provided by the user in the name field of the provider. In the case of a predefined provider, the alias would be the provider name by default.This is an optional field, although we have to keep the value of the provider name if the user does not provide any value.A maximum of 255 characters is allowed.**Handle Duplicates?**- Choose whether to update the record or skip the record.**Assign To**- Choose an owner or team for assigning newly created contacts to a single person or use a round-robin distribution policy to distribute newly created records among the team members.**Assign Tag**- You can choose a tag to be assigned to newly created records.
The tags that are already added to your account could be added too.**Add to List**- Optionally choose to add newly created records to be added to a particular marketing list.
