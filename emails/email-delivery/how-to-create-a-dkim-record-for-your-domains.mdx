The emails that you send to your contacts via Workflows might have via salesmate.io OR salesmatemail.com appear in the from address when they receive it. If you’d like to hide this in your emails, it is highly recommended that you add DKIM records to your domain.

Different mailboxes require different configuration steps to be followed.

If your host is GoDaddy, [check this article.](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/360006687772)

*   Now, Go to your domain registrar's website. You can find your DNS provider using [Whois](https://www.whois.com/) service

*   Log in to the domain control panel.

*   Open your DNS configuration settings.

*   Find the page for updating your domain's DNS records. You can find it under DNS records, DNS Zone file, Advanced DNS or something similar.

| Type | Host | Points to | TTL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CNAME | em5497 | u7797592.wl093.sendgrid.net | 1 Hour |
| CNAME | s1._domainkey | s1.domainkey.u7797592.wl093.sendgrid.net | 1 Hour |
| CNAME | s2._domainkey | s2.domainkey.u7797592.wl093.sendgrid.net | 1 Hour |
| Note: Some domains need you to specify the complete Host thus enter:em5497.demo.io, s1._domainkey.demo.io & s2._domainkey.demo.io respectively |


***Save**your changes when you’re done.

*   After you’ve published the records in your Domain Name System, log into your Salesmate account as Administrator

*   Wait for about 30 minutes ( This could take as long as 24 - 48 hours depending on your service provider )

*   In Salesmate, navigate to**Setup > Sales Automation >  Outgoing Email Setting***   Hit the**verify**button to verify your domain name

*   Once verified the domain will be tagged as**verified.**![](./How to create a DKIM record for your domains_ – Salesmate_files/mceclip2.png)**Note:**You can expect a propagation time from 30 minutes up to 24 hours. This is because it takes time for the DNS to take effect across the internet. The actual time of propagation may vary in some locations based on your network setup.


*   In case of any errors refer to the possible reasons for [DKIM verification failure](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/360006677972-DKIM-Verification-Failure-Possible-Reasons).
