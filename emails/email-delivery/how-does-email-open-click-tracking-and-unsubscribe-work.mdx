### Email Tracking and the GDPR


*   If your company deals with EU-based customers then you must meet the requirements of EU Laws. The [GDPR](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/reform/files/regulation_oj_en.pdf) is implemented to protect people's privacy and impose limits on anyone collecting, using, storing, or processing personal data.

*   European data protection authorities have expressed the [opinion](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2006/wp118_en.pdf) that email tracking requires that recipients have opted-in to the collection of tracking data. While not at the same level as the GDPR itself, such opinions are often taken into account when resolving disputes.

*   Salesmate recommends that you understand the requirements of the GDPR and that you consult a professional, if necessary.
