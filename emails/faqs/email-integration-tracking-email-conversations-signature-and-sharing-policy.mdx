### Outbound Emails (SMTP)

To configure your outgoing emails:

- Navigate to the**Email\*\***icon\*\*on the left menu bar

### Your Smart BCC Address (Incoming Emails)

### Automatic Email Linking

Automatic linking to deals, Salesmate allows you to link your emails to the deals in two ways:

- Link emails manually only

- Automatically link emails with deals

Salesmate will look for an open deal with the person the email was sent to. If only one open deal is found with the person, the email is linked to that deal automatically.

### E-Mail Sharing Permission

Email Module has a special security mechanism, different from the other modules.

Email Sharing can be done either to individual emails, or the user can define a policy for sharing the emails by default.**Email Sharing has the following 3 policies:\*** My email conversations on Deals for other users

- My email conversations on Activities for other users

- My email conversations on Contacts for other users**The Sharing permissions are:\*\*\***Private\*\*(default: when a new user is created)
  - All emails associated with the record will be visible to that user only
  - Email will be visible to users with whom the user has explicitly shared the email or manually shared the particular email with a user.

**_Share with teammates and owner_** All**teammates**and**owners**of the record will be able to see the email associated with that particular record.
_ Email will not be visible to all the users who see the particular record if they are not followers or owner
_ Email will be visible to users with whom the user has explicitly shared the email or manually shared the particular email with a user marking him in CC or To

**_Public_** All followers and owners of the record will be able to see the email associated with that particular record.
_ Email will be visible to all the users who see the particular deal even if they are not followers or owners.
_ Email will be visible to users with whom the user has explicitly shared the email or manually shared the particular email with a user.

![](./Email Integration - Tracking Email Conversations, Signature and Sharing Policy – Salesmate_files/mceclip10.png)

- Your signature and company disclaimer will be attached to every email sent from Salesmate.

### Setting up your Signature

- Navigate to the**Profile Icon**on the top right corner

- Click on**Go to My\*\***Accounts**\* Head over to the**General Category**\* Go to E**mail Signature\*\*![](./Email Integration - Tracking Email Conversations, Signature and Sharing Policy – Salesmate_files/mceclip0(3).png)

- By default, we provide a one-liner signature - "Sent from Salemsate", which can be customized as per your need.

<Note>
**Note:**

- Hierarchy is not applicable in email sharing.
- In case if the email is associated with two objects, let's say Deal and Contact, now if the user's email sharing policy is conflicting for both modules then, the least restrictive policy will be applicable for the email. This does not mean that email will be visible on the timeline of both the objects, it will be visible on the timeline of objects as per the object's policy, but if the email is available to the user by any means, then the least restrictive policy will be applicable.

</Note>

You can also track your email opens, and links clicked in the email sent. To know more, [click here.](https://support.salesmate.io/knowledge/articles/115000147149/)
