Go to your Gmail settings and select “Forwarding and POP/IMAP” (the direct link should be [https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/fwdandpop](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/fwdandpop)).
Verify:
“Enable**IMAP”**should be selected.“Do not limit the number of messages in an IMAP folder” should be selected.Save the above settings.
