Emails will be automatically linked to the contacts matching the email address in Salesmate. If the contact has only one deal open, the email will get attached automatically to the deal.If the contact has more than one deal open, then the system won't automatically attach the email to the deal as it won't be able to figure out to which deal the email is related. You need to attach the deal to that email from Salesmate Mailbox.
