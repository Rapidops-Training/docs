title: "How to use Unsubscribe link in Email Templates"
---
You can add an **unsubscribe** link to your emails using templates that are sent from the Contact / Activity / Deal page or using the compose email option in Inbox, Gmail Chrome extensions, or mobile applications.

This link allows recipients to opt out of receiving such emails from your account.
Adding unsubscribe links to your email communications can help you stay compliant with spam laws (e.g., CAN-SPAM, GDPR, CASL) and improve email deliverability by allowing unengaged recipients to opt out.

You can add the unsubscribe link to the following:

- [Email Templates](#email-templates)

- [Campaign Templates](#campaign-templates)
