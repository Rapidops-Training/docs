### How to Create a Still Image of Your Video With a Play Button


*   Take a screenshot of the paused section of the video.

*   When the video, it automatically includes a "Play" button. To add one to a still image, go to the website [Add Play Button to Image](http://addplaybuttontoimage.way4info.net/), upload your image, choose a play button design, and click "Create Play Button Image". Then, click "Download Image".

*   Next, simply click "Insert Image" in your email to include the image with the Play button. Then, highlight the image and select "Insert Link". Copy-and-paste the link to the full video.

*   When a user clicks on your image, they'll be redirected to the full video. Make sure the video is set to auto-play so the user doesn't have to click "Play" again.
