<Note>
**In case of Errors, please check the below points:**

Due to security concerns, Google has removed the **Less Secure Apps (LSA) feature**. Therefore, it is no longer possible to use the LSA setting to allow access to third-party apps that do not support modern authentication.

If you encounter errors while connecting, you may need to use an alternate method to allow the third-party app access to your Google account. You can use **App Passwords** to authenticate the third-party app. Here are the steps to generate an App Password:

- Sign in to your **Google Account.**
- Go to the **Security tab.**
- Under "**Signing in to Google,**" select **App Passwords.**
- Select the app and device you want to generate the app password for.
- Follow the instructions to enter the **App Password.**
