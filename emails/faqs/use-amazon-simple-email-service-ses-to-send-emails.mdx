### Verify An Email Address

Add and verify your email address following these steps:


*   Log into the [Amazon SES Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses).


*   Click the “Verify a New Email Address” link.


*   In the “Verify a New Email Address” dialog, enter the email address you wish to send messages from and click the “Verify This Email Address” button.

*   You should now receive a verification message from Amazon SES asking you to confirm that you are the owner of the email address. Click the verification link in the message.

*   > NOTE: The verification link is only valid for 24 hours after your original request.


*   Check the status of the email address in the Amazon SES Console. The status of the email address should change from “pending verification” to “verified”.


*   You can now use Amazon SES to send email messages from this address. To send a test email, check the box next to the verified email address, and then click the “Send a Test Email” button. Refer to the [Amazon SES documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-email-addresses.html) for more information.



### Request Removal Of Amazon SES Restrictions

To protect customers from fraud and abuse, Amazon SES does not immediately grant unlimited Amazon SES usage to new users. A number of restrictions are initially in effect, such as only being able to send email to and from verified email addresses and being limited to a maximum of 200 messages in every 24-hour period.

To remove these restriction on recipient addresses and increase the sending limits, [request a higher level of access in the Amazon Support Center](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/request-production-access.html).
