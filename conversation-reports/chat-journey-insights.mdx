Chat Journey Insights shows the insights for all published chat journeys in a centralized location.

*   By consolidating this information into one place, users can easily access and review the performance metrics, trends, and analytics associated with each chat journey.

*   This centralized approach facilitates efficient monitoring and analysis of multiple chat journeys, enabling users to make informed decisions and optimizations based on the collective data.

*   Add this report to your dashboard by clicking on '**Add widget**' and choosing the conversations filter on the left panel then selecting the report and clicking on the '**Add to dashboard**' option.
