### View the conversation ratings in the selected period of time, to determine the performance over time.

Salesmate Messenger provides you with an option to collect ratings of the conversations that help in understanding the area of improvement and the level of great work your team is doing. This is all displayed beautifully with the help of this report and [another report that shows remarks.](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/6906586206105)

The report can help you understand,


*   How many conversations are getting good or bad ratings?

*   By default, the report displays ratings received for the number of conversations in the last 7 days, but the time period can be changed by the user.
