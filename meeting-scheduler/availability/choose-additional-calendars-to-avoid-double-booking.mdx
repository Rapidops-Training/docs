- **Double booking** is when someone schedules **more than one** appointment for the same **time slot.

- ** In order to avoid double booking, we need to ensure that all the relevant calendars are connected under your account to check for availability.

<Note>

**Note:** By default Salesmate checks for the available slots under your primary and the in-built system calendar.
