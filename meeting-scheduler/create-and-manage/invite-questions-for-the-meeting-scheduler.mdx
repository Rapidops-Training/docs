#### **Confirmation Options**

* Customize a meeting confirmation message on how you would like to notify the invitees on the scheduling page.  

* You can choose whether to show a successful confirmation message to your customers or auto-redirect them to a website URL for the next steps.  

**On Confirmation:**

* **Display Salesmate Confirmation Message:** Salesmate's default confirmation message will be shown.  
* **Display button to schedule another event:** If selected, it will display a button to the invitee to book another call.  
  * **Button Name:** You can customize the button name. By default, it is shown as “Schedule Another Meeting.” You can rename it (e.g., “Schedule New Meeting”).  
  * **Success Message:** You can include an additional message above the default message to make it look more personalized.  
    *Example:* “Your meeting is booked with \{Organization Name\}.”
