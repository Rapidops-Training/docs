### Host and Location

Select the Round Robin distribution policy criteria following which the scheduled calls would be assigned to the teammates.

**\*Assign by Priority:**Here, you would need to set the priority for each user where we can assign numbers in order to set the priority preference.
_ Eg: User A, be on top then User B, and so on so forth. Users with the 1st position (User A) will get the activity first, then the user at 2nd or 3rd priority.
_ For example, if two users are available on a particular date and time, who should get the first meeting? That's when this option comes in handy.

**\*Assign by Equal Distribution:**Upon this selection, Meetings will be assigned in a Round-Robin manner i.e. 1st scheduled meeting to User A, 2nd to User B, 3rd to User C, and then back to User A (in a team of 3).
