In modern conversational systems, such as chatbots or virtual assistants, the assistant is usually responsible for handling most interactions—like answering FAQs, guiding users through steps, or helping them find information. However, not every request is simple. Users may want to book a ticket, check their account history, make a payment, or complete tasks that require secure backend access. In these moments, the assistant needs a reliable helper that can take over and complete the task quickly and accurately.  
  
This is where **AI Pilots** come into play. An **AI Pilot** is like a smart, task-specific agent that supports the main assistant by handling complex or secure operations in the background. You can think of it as a mini expert—trained and configured to do one specific job really well. Instead of overloading the main assistant with technical workflows, AI pilots take responsibility for these high-value actions, so the conversation stays smooth and efficient for the end user.
