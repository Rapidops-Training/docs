Voice AI Pilot is a feature in Salesmate that lets you create intelligent agents to answer customer calls automatically. Instead of a human agent, the AI can handle conversations, follow preset flows, and reduce the workload for your team. By linking your purchased phone numbers to an AI Pilot, you can automate customer interactions over voice channels and ensure no call goes unanswered.

<Note>
**Note:** Before adding a phone number to AI Pilot, make sure you have purchased a phone number with Salesmate Voice & Text functionality.
