**What exactly is the Voice AI Pilot?**

*   Acts like your phone’s smart assistant inside Salesmate.
    
*   Assign a phone number to an AI-powered agent to answer calls, talk to callers, and follow your defined flow.
    
*   Saves your team time while delivering a great caller experience.
    
*   **Note:** Works only with the Salesmate Voice app.
    

**What do I need before I can use it?**

*   A phone number purchased under **Voice Configuration**.
    
*   An AI Pilot set up to handle calls.
    
*   The **Salesmate Voice app** installed, with the Voice channel active in your chat workspace.
    

**Can I use this with other calling tools like Dialpad or RingCentral?**

*   No - currently works only with the Salesmate Voice app.
    

**Can I connect one number to multiple AI Pilots?**

*   No - a phone number can only be linked to one AI Pilot at a time.
    

**Can one AI Pilot handle calls from different numbers?**

*   Yes - you can have several phone numbers ring to the same AI Pilot.
    

**What happens if my AI Pilot doesn’t have a conversation flow?**

*   The call will end immediately.
    
*   An error message will display: **“Something went wrong.”**
    

**Can the AI Pilot transfer calls to a human?**

*   Yes - works like a warm transfer, sending the call directly to the chosen user even if that number is shared.
    

**What if I transfer a call to someone who doesn’t have a number assigned?**

*   They will not receive the call.
    

**Can I move a phone number back from the AI Pilot to a human user?**
