###  Tips for Entity Management

- **Understand your domain:** Identify key pieces of information your AI needs.

Example: For a hotel booking assistant, use entities like check_in_date, room_type, location.

- **Define a clear purpose for each entity:** Each entity should capture only one specific type of data.
 Example: Use flight_date to capture the travel date instead of a vague travel_info entity.

- **Keep entities granular:** Break down data into smaller, useful parts for more accurate recognition.
 Example: Use departure_city and arrival_city instead of a general city entity.

- **Include synonyms and variations:** Add different ways users may refer to the same item.
 Example: For drinks, include values like soda, pop, soft drink, and beverage.

- **Expand entities over time using real user input:** Monitor actual user phrases and update entity values accordingly.
 Example: If users type “non-veg” often, add it as a value for food preferences.

- **Avoid overlapping or redundant entities:** Make sure each entity has a distinct and non-conflicting role.
 Example: Use only arrival_city instead of multiple similar entities like end_city or final_city.

- **Keep values relevant to your AI’s purpose:**Only include values that your AI supports or can respond to properly.
 Example: For payment options, include credit card, debit card if those are the only accepted methods.

**Note:**Entity **Name** and **Type** cannot be changed once in useIf the entity exists in intents, flows or prompts, an error message will prevent deletion and lists where it’s used.
