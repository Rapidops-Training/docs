### Tips for Entity Management**Understand your domain:**Identify key pieces of information your AI needs.
Example: For a hotel booking assistant, use entities like check\_in\_date, room\_type, location.**Define a clear purpose for each entity:**Each entity should capture only one specific type of data.
Example: Use flight\_date to capture the travel date instead of a vague travel\_info entity.**Keep entities granular:**Break down data into smaller, useful parts for more accurate recognition.
Example: Use departure\_city and arrival\_city instead of a general city entity.**Include synonyms and variations:**Add different ways users may refer to the same item.
Example: For drinks, include values like soda, pop, soft drink, and beverage.**Expand entities over time using real user input:**Monitor actual user phrases and update entity values accordingly.
Example: If users type “non-veg” often, add it as a value for food preferences.**Avoid overlapping or redundant entities:**Make sure each entity has a distinct and non-conflicting role.
Example: Use only arrival\_city instead of multiple similar entities like end\_city or final\_city.**Keep values relevant to your AI’s purpose:**Only include values that your AI supports or can respond to properly.
Example: For payment options, include credit card, debit card if those are the only accepted methods.**Note:**Entity**Name**and**Type**cannot be changed once in useIf the entity exists in intents, flows or prompts, an error message will prevent deletion and lists where it’s used.
