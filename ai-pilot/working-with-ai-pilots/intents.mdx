Salesmate's AI Pilots utilize **intents** to interpret and classify user requests effectively. An intent represents a specific action or goal the user aims to achieve, such as booking a meeting or checking an order status. These intents work in tandem with **entities** to facilitate structured and contextual conversations. While an intent identifies what the user wants, entities extract specific details from the request.

### What is an Intent?

An **intent** is a predefined action the AI Pilot recognizes and responds to based on user input. For instance, if a user says, "Schedule a call with Alex tomorrow at 5 PM," the AI Pilot identifies the intent as Schedule Meeting and extracts Alex as a Name entity and tomorrow at 5 PM as a Date/Time entity.

### Best Practices for Intent Management

*   **Be Clear and Concise**: Name intents based on purpose (e.g., OrderTracking, not Task1).
*   **Avoid Overlapping Intents**: Ensure similar phrases do not belong to multiple intents.
*   **Use Context Wisely**: Set and clear context appropriately to avoid confusion.
*   **Expand and Improve**: Regularly update training phrases to reflect actual user input.
*   **Test Frequently**: Test intents in real-world scenarios to improve accuracy.

### Handling Partial Matches and Multi-Intent Phrases

Users may sometimes include multiple requests in one message, such as "I need to reset my password and also, what are your support hours?" Salesmate's AI Pilot will typically identify only one top intent per message. **Recommendations**:

*   **Address One Intent at a Time**: Design your AI Pilot flow to handle one request per interaction.
*   **Use Fallback Responses**: If multiple intents are detected, prompt the user to clarify their request.

<Note>
**Note**: By effectively managing intents and entities, you can enhance the conversational capabilities of Salesmate's AI Pilots, leading to more natural and efficient user interactions.
