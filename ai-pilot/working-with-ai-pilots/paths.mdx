- \*\*Paths \*\*let you control the different directions a conversation can go based on the user’s choices. Think of them as branches in a decision tree. Depending on what the user says or does, the agent will follow a specific path to keep the experience smooth and relevant.

### When to Use Paths

Paths are useful when you want your AI agent to:

- Respond differently based on user input (like "yes" vs. "no")
- Guide the conversation through multiple logical steps
- Pass specific data (called variables) when switching to another path

For example, you might create a `Confirmed` path if the user agrees to something, and a `Declined` path if they don’t. Each path would take the conversation in a different direction.

### How to Configure Paths

To set up a path for your agent:

- Navigate to **AI Pilots** from the left side bar.

- If you already have existing AI Pilots, click the **dropdown** from the header and select your **AI Pilot**

- Go to **Agents** tab
- Here, select **existing** Agent or **create** a New Agent

- Scroll to the **Paths** section on the right-hand side

Now, follow these steps:

- Click **Add Path**
- Give your path a name (e.g., `Confirmed`, `Declined`)
- Add a short description of what this path is for so the assistant understands when to use it.

  Tip : This helps the LLM know when this path is the right choice based on user intent.
- Add any variables you want to pass along with this path (Optional)
- Save the configuration

  \*\*Note: \*\*You can’t add the same path name more than once for a single agent.
