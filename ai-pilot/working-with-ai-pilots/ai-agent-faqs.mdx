###  What is the Feature?

- **Q1. What is an AI Pilot?** An AI Pilot in Skara is like a smart assistant that helps your main chatbot handle more complex or sensitive tasks behind the scenes. While your chatbot manages everyday conversations, an AI Pilot can step in to do things like troubleshoot technical issues, recommend products, generate invoices, or collect feedback—quickly and securely. This keeps the user experience smooth, without needing to leave the conversation or wait for manual help.

- **Q2. How does an AI Agent differ from a traditional chatbot or workflow?** An AI Agent in Skara is more advanced than a traditional chatbot or a simple workflow. While chatbots usually follow a fixed script and workflows handle basic tasks, AI Agents are smart, modular components designed to handle specific, complex requests—like processing data, calling APIs, or guiding users through multi-step actions. They work alongside your assistant, taking care of heavy tasks so the main conversation stays fast and focused.

- **Q3. What are Voice Agents and how will they work once launched?** Voice Agents in Skara are intelligent assistants that can answer customer calls automatically using your AI Pilot. Once launched, you can assign a phone number to an AI Pilot, and whenever someone calls that number, the Voice Agent will pick up and talk to the customer based on the conversation flow you’ve designed. This means you don’t need a human agent to answer every call—your Voice Agent will understand what the customer needs, provide answers, ask questions, or even guide them through steps like booking appointments or collecting details. It helps businesses handle more calls without extra staff, making support faster and more efficient.

- **Q4. What’s the key difference between Pilots, Agents, and Voice Agents?** In Skara, AI Pilots are the smart brains behind your automation—they manage conversations and workflows based on what you’ve built. AI Agents are chat-based assistants that help customers through live chat, answering questions or collecting info. Voice Agents, on the other hand, are designed for phone calls. They use your AI Pilot’s flows to speak with customers who call your business number. So, Pilots power everything, Agents handle chat, and Voice Agents handle calls. Each one plays a unique role in helping your team support customers more efficiently across channels.

- **Q5. Are these features no-code or low-code? Who can build with them?** Skara’s AI Agents and Pilots are designed to be **low-code**, meaning most features can be set up without deep programming knowledge. The interface is user-friendly with guided steps, making it accessible for product managers, marketers, and support teams. However, adding advanced functions (like API calls) may require basic technical know-how. So whether you're non-technical or slightly technical, you can build and customize with ease.

###  Feature Pricing & Plans **Q6. Are AI Pilots included in all subscription plans?

- **Q7. Are there any additional costs for using AI Agents or Voice Agents?**Yes, there may be additional costs when using AI Agents or Voice Agents in Skara.

The number of tokens used depends on the AI model you choose and how much input/output is involved in each interaction. So while the features are included in your plan, usage beyond the free credit quota may incur extra charges.

- **Q8. Is usage billed per task, per interaction, or per user seat?**Usage for AI Agents and Voice Agents is **billed based on tokens**, not per task, interaction, or user seat. Tokens represent the amount of data processed—both the user’s input and the AI’s response—and are converted into **credits**, which are deducted from your usage quota. This means you only pay for what the AI actually processes, making it a flexible and scalable pricing model.

###  Troubleshooting **Q26. Why is my AI Pilot not responding or executing tasks?

- **If your Skara AI Pilot seems inactive, first check that its conversation flow is published and activated. Next, ensure the correct trigger is set—such as a chat inbox or voice channel. Finally, verify user access and plan entitlements. If all settings look right, a quick republish usually restores normal operation. You can also review the Pilot’s activity log for any error messages.**Q27. What to do if my Agent doesn’t escalate to a human?

- **When an Agent fails to transfer a conversation, review the escalation step in your flow. Make sure you’ve placed a clear “Transfer to Human” action and specified the correct team or user. Also check that those users have access to the channel and are online. After updating, republish the flow. In Skara, you can test the transfer path directly in the flow builder before going live.**Q28. Why are Voice Agent calls not getting triggered?

- **If incoming calls aren’t reaching your Voice Agent, confirm that the phone number is assigned correctly in Skara Voice Configuration. Next, ensure the voice channel is enabled in your chat settings. Also verify that your AI Pilot is active and that the number-to-Pilot mapping hasn’t been changed. A missing assignment or disabled voice channel is the most common cause.**Q29. How to debug task flow errors in AI Pilots?

- **To troubleshoot errors, open your AI Pilot’s flow in Skara’s builder and look for any steps marked with warnings. Use the built‑in test chat or voice simulator to replicate the issue and view real‑time logs. Adjust any broken steps—such as missing variable mappings or unreachable actions—and republish. Reviewing the execution history in Settings can also help you pinpoint exactly where tasks failed.**Q30. My Agent is giving incorrect responses — how can I fix or retrain it?

- **When your Skara Agent replies inaccurately, revisit the conversation flow and edit the problematic response blocks. Simplify prompts, clarify conditions, and update fallback messages. You can also add more sample phrases under each intent to improve matching. After saving, test again in the preview tool. Iterating quickly in the flow builder helps your Agent learn the right replies without deep technical work.
