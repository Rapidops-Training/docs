title: "Adding MCP Client Integration in AI Pilots"
---

Skara allows you to connect with third-party **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** servers to extend tool capabilities within your AI Pilots dynamically. These integrations enable secure, real-time, and server-based tool execution, either through predefined providers or custom connections.

An **MCP Integration** lets your AI Pilots call external tools hosted on remote servers via a standard protocol. Once connected, the MCP server makes available one or more tools (via metadata or capabilities endpoints) that you can use in your AI workflows without needing to define every input/output manually.
