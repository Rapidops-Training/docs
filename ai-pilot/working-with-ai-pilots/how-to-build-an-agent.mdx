title: "How to Build an Agent"
---

In this article, we’ll discuss how **agents** function as dedicated modules that integrate effortlessly into a conversation flow. Agents are equipped to handle **specific user requests** that go beyond the standard capabilities of the assistant.

By delegating these complex tasks to agents, your main assistant remains focused on its core interactions, keeping it efficient and responsive. This setup also allows your system to be modular and adaptable, supporting advanced functionalities without adding unnecessary complexity.

Once an agent is built, it can be easily **incorporated into an execution flow** using the **Agent action**, expanding your assistant’s range of abilities in just a few steps.
