Execution Flows are essential for running AI Pilots. Without an execution flow, your AI Pilot cannot take action. These flows define how conversations are triggered, managed, and executed in real time.

<Note>
  Execution Flows are similar to Smart Flows but tailored specifically for AI Pilots, with minor differences in functionality and setup.

- **Flow Manager **
  - Manage local variables similar to Smart Flows.
- **Execution Settings**
  - Replaces enrollment conditions to control how and when flows run.
- **Version History**
  - Track flow changes over time.
- **Enrollment Logs**
  - Monitor when and how flows were triggered.
- **Live View & Insights**
  - View ongoing conversations and flow stats.endencies of the flow to proceed with deletion.

<Note>
  ### Best Practices

  - Use clear names and descriptions for each flow
  - Organize triggers and actions in a logical layout
  - Test flows with various scenarios
  - Use execution settings to manage timing and availability
  - Monitor flows with **Live View** and **Insights**
