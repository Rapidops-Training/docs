Execution Flows are essential for running AI Pilots. Without an execution flow, your AI Pilot cannot take action. These flows define how conversations are triggered, managed, and executed in real time.

Execution Flows are similar to Smart Flows but tailored specifically for AI Pilots, with minor differences in functionality and setup.**Topics Covered**[What is an Execution Flow](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/45878729348121-Execution-Flows#h_01JWQAN2AQY5K145PFZ0FMM0DN)[How to Create an Execution Flow](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/45878729348121-Execution-Flows#h_01JWQAN2AQ13CPREV78QNMHDAV)[Best Practices](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/45878729348121-Execution-Flows#h_01JWQCKYV65NT6BHE634EX5WA8)

### What is an Execution Flow?

An**Execution Flow**defines the journey an AI Pilot follows once triggered by a user event like a message or action on the website.

### How to Create an Execution Flow

Follow these steps to create an execution flow:

### Best Practices

Use clear names and descriptions for each flowOrganize triggers and actions in a logical layoutTest flows with various scenariosUse execution settings to manage timing and availabilityMonitor flows with**Live View**and**Insights**
