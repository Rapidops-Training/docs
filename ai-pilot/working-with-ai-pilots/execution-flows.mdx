Execution Flows are essential for running AI Pilots. Without an execution flow, your AI Pilot cannot take action. These flows define how conversations are triggered, managed, and executed in real time.

Execution Flows are similar to Smart Flows but tailored specifically for AI Pilots, with minor differences in functionality and setup.

### What is an Execution Flow?

An **Execution Flow** defines the journey an AI Pilot follows once triggered by a user event like a message or action on the website.

### How to Create an Execution Flow

- *Flow Manager** Manage local variables similar to Smart Flows.

- **Execution Settings** Replaces enrollment conditions to control how and when flows run.

- **Version History** Track flow changes over time.

- **Enrollment Logs** Monitor when and how flows were triggered.

- **Live View & Insights** View ongoing conversations and flow stats.endencies of the flow to proceed with deletion.

### Best Practices

Use clear names and descriptions for each flowOrganize triggers and actions in a logical layoutTest flows with various scenariosUse execution settings to manage timing and availabilityMonitor flows with **Live View** and **Insights**
