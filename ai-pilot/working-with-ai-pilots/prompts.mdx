**Prompts** are structured instructions that guide your conversational **AI Pilot** in generating relevant and context-aware responses. They act like a playground for training, testing, and fine-tuning AI behavior before using it in live flows.  
**  
For example:**  
If a prompt is created for “Flight Booking Inquiry” and a user says, _“_I want to book a flight to New York,” the AI Pilot identifies the intent and responds:  
“Sure! Please provide your preferred travel dates._”

### Components of a Prompt

When creating prompts for your AI assistant, it's important to structure them with the right components. Here’s how each part works and how you can use them:

*   **System Prompt:** You can use this to set the tone, style, and behavior of the AI. Whether you want the assistant to be formal, friendly, concise, or informative, define that here.  
    For example: “You are a helpful and empathetic support agent who answers questions clearly and politely.”
*   **User & AI Pilot Messages:** These are sample conversations that show the AI how it should respond. Use them to guide the AI's behavior by providing real-world scenarios and expected replies.
*   **Conversation History:** You can include past messages when you want the AI to understand the full context of an ongoing interaction. This helps the AI respond more accurately and maintain continuity.
*   **Variables:** You can add variables or entities like {`user_name`} or {`product`} to personalize messages dynamically. This makes your responses feel more tailored and human-like.
*   **Structured Outputs:** You can decide how you want the AI to format its response. You can request plain text for emails, JSON for API responses, or other formats depending on your needs.

### Steps to Create a Prompt:

*   Navigate to **AI Pilots.**
*   Select your **AI Pilot.**
