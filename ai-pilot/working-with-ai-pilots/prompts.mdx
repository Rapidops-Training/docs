- *Prompts** are structured instructions that guide your conversational **AI Pilot** in generating relevant and context-aware responses.
They act like a playground for training, testing, and fine-tuning AI behavior before using it in live flows.

- **For example:** If a prompt is created for “Flight Booking Inquiry” and a user says, _“I want to book a flight to New York,”_ the AI Pilot identifies the intent and responds:
“Sure! Please provide your preferred travel dates.”

###  Components of a Prompt

When creating prompts for your AI assistant, it's important to structure them with the right components. Here’s how each part works:

- **System Prompt:** Use this to set the tone, style, and behavior of the AI. Whether you want the assistant to be formal, friendly, concise, or informative, define that here.
 _Example:_ “You are a helpful and empathetic support agent who answers questions clearly and politely.”

- **User & AI Pilot Messages:** These are sample conversations that show the AI how it should respond. Use them to guide the AI's behavior by providing real-world scenarios and expected replies.

- - **Conversation History:** Include past messages when you want the AI to understand the full context of an ongoing interaction. This helps the AI respond more accurately and maintain continuity.

- **Variables:** Add variables or entities like `{user_name}` or `{product}` to personalize messages dynamically.
 This makes responses more tailored and human-like.

- **Structured Outputs:** Define how you want the AI to format its response — plain text for emails, JSON for APIs, etc.

- **Description:** Describe the objective of the prompt.

- **System Prompt:** Set the tone and instruction style.

- **User Prompt:** The initial user message to start the prompt.

- **Message Pairs:** Add back-and-forth conversations to enrich training.

- **Variables:** Insert dynamic fields using `{}` for personalization.

- **Conversation History:** Insert the `conversation_history` block once for added context.

- **Templates:** Use predefined templates for quick setup.

- **Reordering:** Rearrange blocks except the System Prompt (fixed at the top).
