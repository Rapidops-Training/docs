### How to Use and Configure

Within the Execution flows, once you have configured your trigger please choose **Capture User Reply** under Chat Conversation. ![Execution-Flows-06-04-2025_04_27_PM.png](./Capture User Reply – Salesmate_files/Execution-Flows-06-04-2025_04_27_PM.png) Once selected, you will need to provide below details:

*   **Name:** Assign a clear and descriptive name for the action to easily identify its purpose.
*   **Description (Optional):** Provide a brief explanation of the action’s function for reference.
*   **Capture to Variable:** Select the variable where the captured reply will be stored.
*   **Listen to Other Intents:** Enable this option if you want the agent to detect and trigger other intents based on the user’s reply.
*   **No Reply Handling:** Enable this option to Send a follow-up message to re-engage the user and send a follow up messages automatically. When enabled, you will need to configure below settings.
*         **Timeout Duration:** Set the time (in seconds or minutes) the system should wait for a user reply before triggering a response.
*          **Re-prompts**: Enter responses which should be sent when no reply is received. You can provide one example and have more responses generated by AI
*   **Additional Output Port for No Reply (If Enabled):**  
    If **No Reply Handling** is enabled, an extra output port is added to manage scenarios where no user reply is received.  
    This allows you to define a **specific path** to follow after all retry prompts are exhausted (e.g., escalation, timeout message).

### Practical Use Case:

Imagine an e-commerce chatbot assisting a customer with placing an order for a personalized product, such as a custom T-shirt. The bot could ask, “Please enter the custom text you’d like printed on your T-shirt.” In this scenario:

*   The **Capture User Reply** action is used to store the customer’s input (e.g., “John’s Birthday Bash”).
*   The reply is saved to a **variable** (e.g., `customText`) that can be passed along to the order management system.
*   If the customer doesn’t respond, the **No Reply Handling** option triggers a gentle reminder like “We need your custom text to complete the order. Please enter it now.”
