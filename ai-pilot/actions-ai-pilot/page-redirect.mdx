### Practical Use Case

Let’s imagine a scenario where the intent "Refund Request" is detected during a chat. You’ve already defined this intent in system. Now, when a user types something like “How can I get a refund?”, the system identifies the intent and automatically triggers a **Page Redirect** action. The user is seamlessly redirected to your refund policy page `https://yourcompany.com/help/refund-policy`. This redirect event is then logged in the conversation timeline for future reference or follow-up.
