Once configured, hit**Save**to include this action in your flow.

### Practical Example:

Letâ€™s take a scenario from your website: sometimes users might enter an incorrect email address or make a typo while filling out a form. To handle this, you can use the**Function Action**in your Smart Flow to**verify the email address first**. Once verified, you can then**store the correct email**in your system. This ensures you're capturing only valid and usable email addresses, helping improve your data quality and communication accuracy.
