- The **"Message" action** allows agents to display a **custom message directly to customers during their interaction**. This can be useful for sharing important updates, guiding users through a process, or simply providing a friendly note or reminder. It gives you the flexibility to communicate clearly and contextually at any point in the workflow.

Once configured, the message will display based on your setup and will appear in the flow with the step name and message content visible.

###  Practical Use Case

Imagine a user is browsing your pricing page and opens the chat to ask:**“What’s included in the Pro Plan?”** Instead of waiting for an agent, your Execution Flow detects this query and triggers a **Message Action**:**“Great question! The Pro Plan includes advanced analytics, priority support, and team collaboration tools.”** This delivers immediate value and keeps the user engaged without agent intervention.
