The **"Message" action** allows agents to display a **custom message directly to customers during their interaction**. This can be useful for sharing important updates, guiding users through a process, or simply providing a friendly note or reminder. It gives you the flexibility to communicate clearly and contextually at any point in the workflow.

### Practical Use Case

Imagine a user is browsing your pricing page and opens the chat to ask: **“What’s included in the Pro Plan?”**  
Instead of waiting for an agent, your Execution Flow detects this query and triggers a **Message Action**:  
**“Great question! The Pro Plan includes advanced analytics, priority support, and team collaboration tools.”**  
This delivers immediate value and keeps the user engaged without agent intervention.
