In this article, we will learn about how to configure the Post action. This action displays a popup message to visitors or contacts during a conversation and is particularly useful for gathering quick reactions or text-based feedback—such as asking users if they’re enjoying a specific feature.

*   **Name:** Assign a clear and descriptive name for the action to easily identify its purpose.
*   **Message:** Enter the content of the message to be displayed.  
    Variables or entities can be inserted into the message for dynamic personalization.
*   **Post Type:** Select the display size of the post message—choose between **Small** or **Large**.
*   **Response Type:** Decide how the user should interact with the post:
    *   **Reactions:** Allows you to specify reaction options (e.g., thumbs-up, thumbs-down).
    *   **Text Input:** Enables free-text responses from the user.
*   **Delivery Type:** Choose how the post will be presented—either as a **Snippet** (compact display) or **Full** (expanded display).
*   **Listen to Other Intents:** Enable this option if you want the agent to detect and trigger other intents based on the user’s input. [What is Intent and how to configure](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/What%20is%20Intent%20and%20how%20to%20configure%20%20Intent)

### Practical Use Case:

*   Display a **popup message** like “Hurry! Get 20% off on all orders for the next 24 hours!”
*   Include a **CTA (Call to Action)** button (e.g., “Shop Now” or “Claim Discount”) as part of the **reaction options**.
*   If the customer selects the action, the flow continues with the discount code or directs them to the sales page.
*   If the user doesn’t respond or shows no interest, the flow can provide other shopping recommendations or offer assistance.
