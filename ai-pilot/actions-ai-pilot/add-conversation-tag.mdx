title: "Add Conversation Tag"
---
This action allows agents to automatically add tags to chat conversations within a flow. It helps organize and classify conversations more effectively for easier tracking and reporting. You can add special tags to the conversation as per the conditions set up during the journey. You can add multiple tags to the conversation at the same time. The newly added tags will be appended to the already present tags on the conversation.

###  Practical Example

In a customer support chatbot, when a user mentions billing-related issues (e.g., “I was overcharged” or “Need invoice”), the flow can automatically add tags like **“Billing”** and **“Urgent”** to the conversation using the **Add Conversation Tag** action. These tags help the support team:

- Instantly categorize the chat as a billing issue.
- Prioritize it for faster resolution.
- Enable reporting and filtering of billing-related queries.
- Track the frequency of certain issues over time for process improvements.
