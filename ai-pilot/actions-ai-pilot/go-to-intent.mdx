### Practical Example

Once a chat is initiated on our website, I want to identify the type of support the visitor needs. Based on their response, the lead or contact will be routed to a relevant subflow, such as Technical Support, Billing & Invoice Support, or Order Status, for a more personalized and efficient experience.
