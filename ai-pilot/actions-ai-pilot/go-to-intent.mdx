The**Go to Intent**action allows your AI Agent to instantly jump to a specific intent-based flow at any point during the conversation. This is especially helpful when you want to re-route a user based on their input or choices without re-detecting the intent.**Topics Covered:**[How to Configure**Go to Intent**Action](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/45880325219097-Go-to-Intent#h_01JFB84RHPMPZ2NG0171X91QT9)[Practical Example](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/45880325219097-Go-to-Intent#h_01JWGFQWHFQ79Y6X9K14AYQSJ0)

### Practical Example

Once a chat is initiated on our website, I want to identify the type of support the visitor needs. Based on their response, the lead or contact will be routed to a relevant subflow, such as Technical Support, Billing & Invoice Support, or Order Status, for a more personalized and efficient experience.
