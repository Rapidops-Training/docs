**Send Survey Email** is an action block available in [Smart Flows](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/categories/36619982436121-Smart-Flows) and Agent [Execution Flows](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/45878729348121-Execution-Flows) that lets you automatically send a survey (CSAT, CES, or NPS) to a contact based on specific events or triggers.

This is useful for collecting feedback after customer interactions such as closing a deal, completing an activity, resolving a ticket, or engaging with a contact.

### Practical Example:

Once a user initiates a chat with us, we can automatically capture their basic details such as **name** and **email**, and create a contact record in the system. From there, we can route the conversation to our **AI Agent** to handle their query in real time. After the interaction is complete, we can trigger a **survey** to collect feedback on their experience.
