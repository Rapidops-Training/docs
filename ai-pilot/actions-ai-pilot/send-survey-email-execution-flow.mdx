###  How to Configure the Send Survey Email Action

To configure the **Send Flow Email Action**, you'll need to provide the following details:**Name**: Assign a clear and descriptive name for the action to easily identify its purpose.

- **Description**: Offer a brief explanation of the action’s function.

- **Survey:** Choose from any published surveys (CSAT, CES, or NPS).

- **From Name:** This is the **name of the sender** shown in the recipient’s inbox.

- **From Email:** Email address from which the survey email is sent.

- **Subject:** Subject line of the survey email.

Once the configuration is completed, hit **Save**.

**Note:**If the selected email isn’t found or their email domain isn’t verified, the survey will not be sent, and the process will not move forward.

###  Practical Example:

Once a user initiates a chat with us, we can automatically capture their basic details such as **name** and **email**, and create a contact record in the system. From there, we can route the conversation to our **AI Agent** to handle their query in real time. After the interaction is complete, we can trigger a **survey** to collect feedback on their experience.
