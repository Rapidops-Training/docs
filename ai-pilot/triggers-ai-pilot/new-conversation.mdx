### Practical Example

When a customer initiates a new chat via the **Salesmate Web Widget**, the **New Conversation** trigger activates an AI Pilot flow that:

- Greets the customer automatically.
- Collects basic information (like name, email, or issue type).
- Routes the conversation to the right team, such as **Sales** for pricing inquiries or **Support** for technical issues, based on user responses.

This ensures quicker response times, reduces manual triage, and delivers a personalized experience across channels like **Web**, **WhatsApp**, **Facebook**, or **Voice**.

<Note>
  **Note:**

  - If a selected channel is not installed, you will see this message: \
    "You need to install the app first to configure its triggers, conditions, or actions."
  - If Unified Inbox is not active, this warning will appear: "You need to activate the Unified Conversation Inbox and connect this channel to configure the trigger."
  - If no voice number is assigned to the AI Pilot, you’ll see: "You need to add at least one number to the Voice Channel associated with this AI Pilot to receive and handle the incoming calls."
