This ensures quicker response times, reduces manual triage, and delivers a personalized experience across channels like**Web**,**WhatsApp**,**Facebook**, or**Voice**.**Note:**If a selected channel is not installed, you will see this message:
"You need to install the app first to configure its triggers, conditions, or actions."If Unified Inbox is not active, this warning will appear:
