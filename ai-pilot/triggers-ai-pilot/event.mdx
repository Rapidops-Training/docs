### Practical Example

When a visitor views the Pricing & Plans article in your knowledge base, you want to initiate a conversation asking if they’d like to book a demo. Based on their response, the flow should:

- Send a booking link if the answer is **Yes**
- Redirect to a live agent if the answer is **No**
- Add a "**Potential Customer**" tag if the answer is **Maybe**
