### Configure the Page Visited Trigger

The configuration panel is divided into three sections:

**Page URL:** Set the conditions that define when this trigger should activate based on the web page being visited.

*   Add multiple conditions using **AND** / **OR** operators.
    
*   Choose from the following operators:
    
    *   **is not empty** (default – no value input required)
        
    *   **is**
        
    *   **starts with**
        
    *   **ends with**
        
    *   **contains**
        
    *   **does not contain**
        
    *   **wildcard**
        

**UTM Variable Matching:** Enable this option to refine the trigger using UTM parameters.

*   Available UTM parameters:
    
    *   `utm_source`
        
    *   `utm_medium`
        
    *   `utm_term`
        
    *   `utm_content`
        
    *   `utm_campaign`
        

**Audience (Visitor or Contact):** Define who can see the flow based on user type and behavior.

Choose either:

*   *   **Visitor** (default) – applies to any anonymous visitor.
        
    *   **Contact** – targets only identified users (logged-in or recognized).
        

**Chat Display Behavior:** Configure when the chat flow should appear to the visitor once the conditions are met.

### Practical Example

Let’s say you want to **notify your customers or website visitors** when they land on a specific page of your website — such as a new feature announcement, a discount offer, or a personalized message.

You can use the **"Page Visited"** trigger to do exactly that.
