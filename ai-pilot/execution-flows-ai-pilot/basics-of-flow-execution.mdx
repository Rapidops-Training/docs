###  Flow Structure & Triggers

Each flow must have **only one trigger**. Supported variables include:**Smart Flow variables**(excluding record triggers)**AI Pilot variables**(global and local)**Custom variables** created by usersNote: System default variables are read-only and cannot be edited.If multiple flows match a trigger, the one with the **highest priority**(lowest numerical value) will execute.

###  Flow Initiation & Execution

Flows commence when a visitor performs an action, such as opening a page or clicking a message.A flow starts **only when the visitor clicks** on the message, not merely upon receipt.Flows can be configured to run **once or multiple times** per visitor.

###  Inbox & Messaging Behavior

AI Pilot conversations appear in the inbox **only if “Include Bot Messages” is enabled**. Interactive elements (like cards or carousels) must be displayed in **both the widget and inbox**. AI Pilot conversations are **excluded from the “Recent Conversations” widget**.

###  Flow Continuity & Error Handling

If no input is received and there's no backup step, the flow remains inactive until the visitor responds.If a step expecting input is deleted, the flow restarts from the beginning upon the visitor's reply.If there's no subsequent step and no input expected, the flow concludes.If a flow doesn't save any data, a **"Restart Flow" option** becomes available to the visitor.Deleting a flow during an active conversation removes the chat.

###  User Interaction & Data Management

Always collect the visitor's **email or phone number** to prevent errors when creating new contacts.If a team member responds during a flow, it terminates the ongoing flow.Visitor activity logs display generic names like “Visitor 001” with a link to view the chat.

###  Time & Condition Checks

If a visitor's system time is incorrect, Salesmate adjusts timestamps for consistency.Before displaying a flow message, the system verifies its active status, timing, and condition matches. The message is shown **only after the visitor replies**.
