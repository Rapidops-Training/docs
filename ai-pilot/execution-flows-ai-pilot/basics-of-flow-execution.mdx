AI Pilot Flows empower you to automate customer interactions effectively. To ensure optimal performance, it's crucial to understand the foundational rules and behaviors governing these flows.**Topics covered:**[Flow Structure & Triggers](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/45879772372505-Basics-of-Flow-Execution#01JVVFDXX8V702FA4P2H1G26H8)[Flow Initiation & Execution](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/45879772372505-Basics-of-Flow-Execution#01JVVFEQVWQJV69JB2KMZT2FE5)[Inbox & Messaging Behavior](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/45879772372505-Basics-of-Flow-Execution#01JVVFFXVXJZ3RVRAN53GNVRDR)[Flow Continuity & Error Handling](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/45879772372505-Basics-of-Flow-Execution#01JVVFG3KG18VQ24J3PSEK9N0F)[Inbox & Messaging Behavior](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/45879772372505-Basics-of-Flow-Execution#01JVVFFXVXJZ3RVRAN53GNVRDR)[Flow Continuity & Error Handling](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/45879772372505-Basics-of-Flow-Execution#01JVVFG3KG18VQ24J3PSEK9N0F)[Time & Condition Checks](https://support.salesmate.io/hc/en-us/articles/45879772372505-Basics-of-Flow-Execution#01JVVFG9PP70DDVBXYC8977Z7C)

### Flow Structure & Triggers

Each flow must have**only one trigger**. Supported variables include:**Smart Flow variables**(excluding record triggers)**AI Pilot variables**(global and local)**Custom variables**created by usersNote: System default variables are read-only and cannot be edited.If multiple flows match a trigger, the one with the**highest priority**(lowest numerical value) will execute.

### Flow Initiation & Execution

Flows commence when a visitor performs an action, such as opening a page or clicking a message.A flow starts**only when the visitor clicks**on the message, not merely upon receipt.Flows can be configured to run**once or multiple times**per visitor.

### Inbox & Messaging Behavior

AI Pilot conversations appear in the inbox**only if “Include Bot Messages” is enabled**. Interactive elements (like cards or carousels) must be displayed in**both the widget and inbox**. AI Pilot conversations are**excluded from the “Recent Conversations” widget**.

### Flow Continuity & Error Handling

If no input is received and there's no backup step, the flow remains inactive until the visitor responds.If a step expecting input is deleted, the flow restarts from the beginning upon the visitor's reply.If there's no subsequent step and no input expected, the flow concludes.If a flow doesn't save any data, a**"Restart Flow" option**becomes available to the visitor.Deleting a flow during an active conversation removes the chat.

### User Interaction & Data Management

Always collect the visitor's**email or phone number**to prevent errors when creating new contacts.If a team member responds during a flow, it terminates the ongoing flow.Visitor activity logs display generic names like “Visitor 001” with a link to view the chat.

### Time & Condition Checks

If a visitor's system time is incorrect, Salesmate adjusts timestamps for consistency.Before displaying a flow message, the system verifies its active status, timing, and condition matches. The message is shown**only after the visitor replies**.
