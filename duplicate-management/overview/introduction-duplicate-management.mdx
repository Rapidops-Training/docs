###  Duplication Check

- When creating or editing records, whether quickly or in detail, Salesmate checks for duplicates.

- If duplicates are detected, a warning will appear. In listing view, inline edits, a warning will be shown if configured, or the save button will be disabled with a tooltip stating, “You can’t create duplicate records.”

- In record detail widgets, if duplicates are found, a warning icon will appear with a tooltip showing the number of potential duplicates. Clicking "View duplicates" will open a popup listing them.

- If duplicates are blocked, an error message will prevent saving: “Found Duplicate(s). You can’t create a duplicate record.”

<Note>

**Note:**
* This feature will be available in all plans, but each plan will have some limitations on how it can be used.

- The Duplication check will not work on Deleted/ Restored Records

- When you manually merge records, the system might detect matching criteria, but it doesn’t run a duplication check during the merge process.

- If you save multiple records at once and your duplicate rule is set to block or alert, those records won’t be compared to each other only to the records that already exist in Salesmate.

- Currently, there will be only one rule per module available.
