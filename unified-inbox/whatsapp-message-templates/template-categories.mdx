### **Utility Template Guidelines**

<Tip>
  **Transactional Focus**: Utility templates must be directly related to
  specific transactions and provide clear value to the recipient based on their
  business relationship with you.
</Tip>

- **Transaction-Based**: Must be triggered by customer actions or business processes
- **Informational Content**: Should provide useful, actionable information
- **No Mixed Content**: Avoid combining utility and marketing content
- **Customer Relationship**: Based on existing business relationship
- **Clear Purpose**: Each message should have a specific transactional purpose

## Marketing Templates

### **Purpose and Promotion**

Marketing templates offer the highest degree of flexibility as they aren't tied to specific transactions but rather relate to the business, its products, or services. These templates encompass a variety of content such as promotions, welcoming messages, updates, invitations, or requests for feedback. If a template contains a combination of utility and marketing content, it will be categorized as a marketing template.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Promotions or offers">
    **Sales and promotional content:**
    - "If you buy 2 or more coffees, you'll get $5 off!"
    - "Thanks for your order! Use code SAVE20 for 20% off your next order!"
    - "Your pre-paid balance is low; click here to top up! Get a 10% bonus with code EXTRA10"
  </Accordion>

{" "}
<Accordion title="Welcoming or closing messages">
  **Customer engagement and relationship building:** - "This is Vinny's Bakery
  and we are now on WhatsApp!" - "Hello, welcome to our profile on WhatsApp!" -
  "I'm sorry for the delay, my name is XX, how can I help you?" - "Thank you,
  have a good day" - "Thank you for visiting our store, we really appreciate
  your visit." - "A question for you - how much time are you spending doing your
  hair?"
</Accordion>

{" "}
<Accordion title="Updates, invitations, newsletters, or recommendations">
  **Business updates and community engagement:** - "Our store has moved. Come
  and check us out!" - "We will be closed next Monday for the holiday" - "Good
  news! The product you saved is back in stock." - "Join us for our upcoming
  holiday gala!" - "Here are this month's coupons – happy shopping!" - "Hey
  members, join us tonight for this event" - "We think you will love this –
  check out our new ice cream flavor"
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Requests to respond or complete a new transaction">

    - "Your application is waiting for you. Click here to complete"
    - "You missed your recent appointment, tap here to rebook."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
