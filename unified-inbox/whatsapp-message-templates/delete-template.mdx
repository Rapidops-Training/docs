## Important Considerations

<Warning>
  **Permanent Action**: Template deletion is permanent and has specific
  implications for your WhatsApp communications.
</Warning>

<Note>
  **Key Points to Remember:**

- If you delete a template that has been sent in a conversation as a message but has yet to be delivered (e.g. because the customer's phone is turned off), the template's status will be set to "Pending Deletion" and WhatsApp will attempt to deliver the message for 30 days.
- Names of an approved template that has been deleted cannot be used again for 30 days.
- When the WhatsApp channel is removed, its templates are deleted automatically.
